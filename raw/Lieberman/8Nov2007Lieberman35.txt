watchdogs within each federal agency to enforce greater government accountability  a bipartisan group of four U S  senators introduced legislation today that would significantly strengthen the Inspector General  IG  system for the future     Senators Claire McCaskill  D MO   Susan Collins  R ME   Joseph Lieberman  ID CT   and Tom Coburn  R OK  today filed the Inspector General Reform Act of 2007  S  2324  which will build upon the strong tradition of inspectors general by guaranteeing that qualified individuals are appointed as IGs  that they remain independent of pressure or influence from the government agencies they investigate  and all IG reports and audits are easily accessible to the public                 Inspectors general are very important to making sure this government is accountable to the American people   They have served us well for thirty years  and now it s time to make sure they have the resources and protections they need for the future   Senator McCaskill said      Inspectors General are vital partners in Congress s effort to identify inefficient  ineffective  and improper government programs  The investigations and reports of IGs throughout the government help Congress shape legislation and oversight activities   improving government performance  providing important transparency into programs  and giving Americans better value for their tax dollar   said Senator Collins    The Inspector General Reform Act of 2007 would improve the independence and effectiveness of Inspectors General and contribute to better relations among the IGs  the agencies they serve  and the Congress     It has been almost 30 years since Congress passed the Inspectors General Act of 1978 that created an office of Inspector General to hold major departments and agencies accountable to the public interest  The experiment has been a great success  hailed as a kind of consumer protector for the taxpayer deep within each agency  Now  after several incidents in which the independence of Inspectors General seems to be threatened   as well as some incidents of apparent IG misconduct    we need to revisit the legislation  This legislation will strengthen the independence and accountability of IG offices so that they can continue to be a force for good government   Senator Lieberman said    Inspectors general are true champions for the taxpayers and annually save taxpayers billions of dollars in their quest to root out waste  fraud and abuse   This bill is a great first step to making them more effective   The most important step  however  will be for elected officials to respond to their findings and eliminate the waste and other abuses of the public s trust uncovered by inspectors general   said Senator Coburn   The bill comes after a series of accounts revealing the intimidation felt by IGs from top agency officials   CIA IG John Helgerson is currently the subject of an internal investigation of his activities as IG  and GSA Administrator Lorita Doan has been openly critical of her agency s OIG and tried to cut the budget and responsibilities of the office                 The legislation introduced today aims to strengthen IG offices by ensuring the independence of IGs as they review government agencies  while also establishing a committee to investigate allegations of wrongdoing against inspectors general and their staff     Specifically  the legislation will require that          Congress is notified of any proposed removal of an IG  along with the reasons for the removal  in writing with 30 days notice          All IGs must have their own legal counsel or access to the services of legal counsel of another Inspector General  This will allow them to avoid using agency counsels          A Council on Integrity and Efficiency for Inspectors General must be established   Within the Council  an Integrity Committee must be created to receive  review  and refer for investigation allegations of wrongdoing that are made against Inspectors General or certain other staff members          All IG websites are directly accessible from the home page of agency web sites   All IG reports must be posted on agency websites within 3 working days of its release           In the event of a vacancy  the Council for Integrity and Efficiency will recommend to the appointing authority three possible replacements          The president s budget submission must state how much money they are requesting for each IG office  as well as the funding level the IG requested for their office  This will allow Congress to identify whether agencies are trying to interfere with the work of an IG office by cutting funding          No IG may accept a bonus          Presidentially appointed IGs must be paid at Level III of the Executive Schedule  plus three percent and other IGs must receive compensation comparable to other senior level executives in the department   This is aimed at preventing agencies from discouraging qualified candidates by lowering pay      Similar legislation introduced by Congressman Jim Cooper  D TN  in the House of Representatives received overwhelming bipartisan approval with a vote of 404 11     30
