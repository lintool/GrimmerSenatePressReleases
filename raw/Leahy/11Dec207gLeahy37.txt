       Statement Of Sen  Leahy On The School Safety And Law Enforcement   Improvement Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  On The School Safety And Law Enforcement Improvement      Act  December 11  2007        In the eight months since the horrific incident at Virginia Tech      that resulted in the tragic deaths of 32 students  we have witnessed      a barrage of new incidents involving threatening conduct and  too      often  deadly acts of violence at our schools and college campuses      nationwide              Just this past Saturday  police arrested a student at Loyola      Marymount University in Los Angeles on suspicion of posting an      anonymous online threat to kill people on campus  The threat      appeared on a blog used primarily by college students  It said  I      am going to shoot and kill as many people as I can until which time      I am incapacitated or killed by police  Fortunately  police got to      this troubled student before he could make good on his threat  But      I urge the Senate not to sit back and wait until the next time  when      police may not be able to stop a deadly event before it occurs  We      must act now to protect our schools and college campuses              Those who perpetrate these terrible crimes know no boundaries  No      targets are off limits  This past Sunday  a man killed two people      in Arvada  Colorado after being refused lodging at a Christian      missionary center  Later that day  in Colorado Springs  the same      man opened fire outside the New Life Church  taking the lives of two      teen aged sisters and leaving a third victim in critical condition       These recent incidents make clear yet again that we must do all we      can to ensure that law enforcement is prepared and equipped to      respond to such incidents              I urge Congress to take prompt action to help stem this tide of      violence  The full Senate can begin to address this terrible and      recurring problem by taking up and passing the School Safety and Law      Enforcement Improvement Act of 2007  a legislative package that      responds to the Virginia Tech tragedy and the on going problem of      violence in our schools and in our communities             The Judiciary Committee passed this important bill out of Committee      over four months ago  In passing the bill out of the Judiciary      Committee this past September  the Committee attempted to show      deference to Governor Kaine and the task forces at work in Virginia      and to complement their work and recommendations  Working with      several Senators  including Senators Boxer  Reed  Specter  Feingold       Schumer  and Durbin  the Committee originated this bill and reported      it before the start of the academic year in the hope that the full      Senate could pass these critical school safety improvements this      fall              Regrettably  the bill has been stalled on the Senate floor  I urge      those holding up its passage to consider that this Administration      has spent more than  15 billion to equip  train  and build      facilities for the Iraqi security forces  Surely Congress can stand      up for American kids who face unrelenting school violence by      authorizing just a fraction of this money to reduce deadly violence      in our schools and communities right here at home              I do not think the Senate should continue to stand by and wait for      the next horrific school tragedy to make the critical changes      necessary to insure safety in our schools and on our college      campuses  The risk of school violence will not go away just because      Congress may shift its focus  Since this bill passed out of      Committee  we have seen tragedy at Delaware State  University of      Memphis  SuccessTech Academy in Cleveland  Ohio  as well as      incidents in California  New York  Pennsylvania  and Oregon  to name      just a few  I urge the Senate to move aggressively with the      comprehensive school safety legislation  It includes background      check improvements  together with other sensible yet effective      safety improvement measures supported by law enforcement across the      country  If we are prohibited by objection from doing so by      unanimous consent  then let us move to it and let those with      objections seek to amend those provisions to which they object              There are too many incidents at too many colleges and schools      nationwide  This terrorizes students and their parents  We should      be doing what we can to help              Several weeks ago  a troubled student wearing a Fred Flintstone mask      and carrying a rifle through campus was arrested at St  Johns      University in Queens  New York  prompting authorities to lock down      the campus for three hours  The day after that incident  an armed      17 year old on the other side of the country in Oroville  California      held students hostage at Las Plumas High School  also resulting in a      lock down  The incidents have continued with the arrest a few weeks      ago of an armed student suspected of plotting a Columbine style      attack on fellow high school students in Norristown  Pennsylvania       More recently  in Happy Valley  Oregon  police arrested a      10 year old student who brought a semi automatic weapon into his      elementary school  The students in these situations were lucky and      escaped without injury              University of Memphis student Taylor Bradford was not so lucky  He      was killed on campus on September 30th in what university officials      believe was a targeted attack  He was 21 years old  Shalita      Middleton was not so lucky  She died on October 23rd      from injuries she sustained during the Delaware State incident  She      was 17 years old  Nathaniel Pew was not so lucky  He was wounded      at Delaware State  High school teachers Michael Grassie and David      Kachadourian and students Michael Peek and Darnell Rodgers  all of      whom were wounded by a troubled student at SuccessTech Academy on      October 10th  were not so lucky             The School Safety and Law Enforcement Improvement Act responds      directly to incidents like these by squarely addressing the problem      of violence in our schools in several ways  The bill enlists the      States as partners in the dissemination of critical information by      making significant improvements to the National Instant Background      Check System  known as the NICS system  The bill also authorizes      federal assistance for programs to improve the safety and security      of our schools and institutions of higher education  provides      equitable benefits to law enforcement serving those institutions      including bulletproof vests  and funds pilot programs to develop      cutting edge prevention and intervention programs for our schools       The bill also clarifies and strengthens two existing statutes  the      Terrorist Hoax Improvements Act and the Law Enforcement Officers      Safety Act  which are designed to improve public safety              Specifically  Title I would improve the safety and security of      students both at the elementary and secondary school level  and on      college and university campuses  The K 12 improvements are drawn      from a bill that Senator Boxer introduced in April  and I want to      thank Senator Boxer for her hard work on this issue  The      improvements include increased funding for much needed      infrastructure changes to improve security as well as the      establishment of hotlines and tip lines  which will enable students      to report potentially dangerous situations to school administrators      before they occur             These improvements can save lives  After the four students and      teachers were wounded at SuccessTech Academy  the press reported      that parents had been petitioning to get a metal detector installed      and additional security personnel added  and that the guard who was      previously assigned to the school had been removed three years ago       In fact  the entire City of Cleveland has just 10 metal detectors      that are rotated throughout the citys more that 100 schools  Title      I of the bill would enhance the ability of school district to apply      for and receive grant money to fund the installation of metal      detectors and the training and hiring of security personnel to keep      our kids safe  Over the past four years  this Administration has      spent over  15 billion to equip  train  and build facilities for the      Iraqi security forces  Surely  Congress can stand up for American      kids who face unrelenting school violence by supporting just a small      fraction of this figure for much needed school safety improvements             To address the new realities of campus safety in the wake of      Virginia Tech and more recent college incidents  Title I also      creates a matching grant program for campus safety and security to      be administered out of the COPS Office of the Department of      Justice  The grant program would allow institutions of higher      education to apply  for the first time  directly for federal funds      to make school safety and security improvements  The program is      authorized to be appropriated at  50 000 000 for the next two fiscal      years  While this amounts to just  3 per student each year  it will      enable schools to more effectively respond to dangerous situations      on campus             Title II of the bill seeks to improve the NICS system  The      senseless loss of life at Virginia Tech revealed deep flaws in the      transfer of information relevant to gun purchases between the States      and the Federal Government  The defects in the current system      permitted the perpetrator of this terrible crime to obtain a firearm      even though a judge had declared him to be a danger to himself and      thus ineligible under federal law  Seung Hui Cho was not eligible      to buy a weapon given his mental health history  but he was still      able to pass a background check because data was missing from the      system  We are working to close gaps in the NICS system  Title II      will correct these problems  and for the first time will create a      legal regime in which disqualifying mental health records  both at      the State and Federal level  would regularly be reported into the      NICS system               Title III would make sworn law enforcement officers who work for      private institutions of higher education and rail carriers eligible      for death and disability benefits  and for funds administered under      the Byrne Grant program and the bulletproof vest partnership grant      program  Providing this equitable treatment is in the best interest      of our nations educators and students and will serve to place the      support of the Federal Government behind the dedicated law      enforcement officers who serve and protect private colleges and      universities nationwide  I commend Senator Jack Reed for his      leadership in this area              Title IV of the bill makes improvements to the Law Enforcement      Officers Safety Act of 2003  These amendments to existing law will      streamline the system by which qualified retired and active officers      can be certified under LEOSA  It serves us all when we permit      qualified officers  with a demonstrated commitment to law      enforcement and no adverse employment history  to protect      themselves  their families  and their fellow citizens wherever those      officers may be              Title V incorporates the PRECAUTION Act  which Senators Feingold and      Specter asked to have included  This provision authorizes grants to      develop prevention and intervention programs for our schools             Finally  Title VI incorporates the      Terrorist Hoax Improvements Act of 2007  at the request of Senator      Kennedy      Let us go forward and act now on this      important bill  The Virginia Tech Review Panel  a body      commissioned by Governor Tim Kaine to study the Virginia Tech      tragedy  recently issued its findings based on a 4 month long      investigation of the incident and its aftermath  This bill would      adopt a number of recommendations from the Review Panel aimed at      improving school safety planning and reporting information to NICS       We must not miss this opportunity to implement these initiatives      nationwide  and to take concrete steps to ensure the safety of our      kids             I recognize that there is no solution to fully end the sad      phenomenon of school violence  But the recent tragedies should      prompt us to respond in realistic and meaningful ways when we are      presented with such challenges  I hope the Senate can promptly move      this bill forward to invest in the safety of our students and better      support law enforcement officers across the      country
