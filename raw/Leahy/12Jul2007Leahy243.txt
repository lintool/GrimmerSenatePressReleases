       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Guatemala                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    On Guatemala    July 12  2007 Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  with the Congress s attention on Iraq and     the Middle East  I want to take a moment to alert other Senators to an     important issue in Guatemala  a country that rarely makes the news in     Washington   Many of us remember the decades of civil conflict that caused the     deaths of an estimated 200 000 Guatemalans  many of them indigenous     Mayan civilians  Since those dark days  most Guatemalans have tried to     put that tragic period behind them and to build the institutions of     democracy that can provide economic development  stability and justice      While the Guatemalan Army has shrunk to half its size  the peace     accords that ended the fighting have yet to be fully realized  Most     troubling is the rampant violent crime  organized crime and corruption      much of it perpetrated by illegal armed groups  some of which are     comprised of former members of the security forces and their supporters      During the tenure of President Berger  the Guatemalan Government      with the assistance of the United Nations  has sought to establish a     commission to investigate and prosecute these clandestine groups  The     first attempt was rejected by Guatemala s Constitutional Court  but     recently the Court approved the establishment of an International     Commission against Impunity in Guatemala  CICIG  The CICIG is widely     regarded as an essential mechanism for combating the cancer of human     rights violations and organized crime that are threatening to destroy     the foundations of Guatemala s democracy   It is important to note that the Constitutional Court confirmed that     CICIG would work alongside the Attorney General s office in     investigating illegal groups  Far from weakening national sovereignty      CICIG will support Guatemala by helping to strengthen the capacity of     the country s weak judicial system    Page  S9127  GPO s PDF Not only could CICIG go a long way in     fulfilling the government s commitment under the peace accords to combat     illegal armed groups  it could also help to uncover the full extent of     these groups and dismantle their underlying structure  Most importantly      it would be an unprecedented step in ending the impunity that has been     the greatest impediment to establishing the rule of law in Guatemala      At this point  the future of CICIG is in the hands of the Guatemalan     Congress  and with new elections approaching time is running out  It     would be a terrible waste of years of hard work by the Guatemalan     Government and the United Nations if the CICIG is not approved  Whether     for prospective foreign investors or the surviving families of victims     of political violence  nothing is more important than knowing the truth     and seeing that justice is finally possible   On June 28  the Senate Appropriations Committee  like the House of     Representatives last month  unanimously reported the fiscal year 2008     foreign aid appropriations bill  That legislation would authorize the     resumption of assistance for the Guatemalan Air Force  Navy and Army     Corps of Engineers  if they are respecting human rights and the     Guatemalan Congress ratifies the CICIG agreement   I urge the Guatemalan Congress to seize this historic opportunity      The alternative  which is almost unthinkable  of rejecting this     essential step to uphold the rule of law  would send a chilling message     that it is the forces of crime and violence who will determine     Guatemala s future  That is not an outcome that Guatemala or its people     can afford
