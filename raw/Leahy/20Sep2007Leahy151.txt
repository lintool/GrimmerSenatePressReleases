       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Feingold Amendment To Redeploy   Troops From Iraq                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt        On The Feingold Amendment To Redeploy Troops From Iraq    September 20  2007 Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  I strongly support the     Feingold Amendment  of which I am a cosponsor  This is the strongest     amendment for changing course in Iraq among the proposals that we will     consider this week  It is the only proposal that addresses the     Presidents failed Iraq policy head on  and that would begin the much     needed redeployment of our forces within 90 days   The invasion of Iraq  and the catastrophe it has     caused for the Iraqi people  for Iraqs neighbors  and for the United     States  must end  It has been a failure  a failure in terms of our     strategic interests  a failure in making us safer  a failure in terms of     the Presidents na  ve goal of imposing a new Iraqi government by force      Our troops have stepped up time and time again      many of them sacrificing their lives  and many more suffering severe     injuries  Their performance has been superb  Despite what the     President and some who defend his policies say  our troops are not the     issue  The issues are the glaring shortfalls  and the appalling     incompetence  of the Presidents strategy   The surge has not brought the Iraqi factions any     closer to political reconciliation  which after all is the ultimate goal     of the surge strategy  In fact  the divisions among the Iraqi people      already deep because of the brutal manipulations of the Saddam Hussein     regime    seem to be worsening  The White House seems to have no idea     how to call things off and get our troops out from the middle of Iraqs     civil war   The cold hard truth is that the President has     presented the American people with no real option  just more of the     same  If the President is going to ignore our true national interests     by prolonging this conflict  if the Commander in Chief of our armed     forces is not going to take responsibility  then Congress  as     representatives of the people  must be the catalyst to chart a new     course   The Iraqi Government is only getting more dependent     on a continued American presence  It is the consensus view of our     intelligence community  as reflected in the latest National Intelligence     Assessment  that there is no prospect that in the next year the Iraqis     will come together and reach a political settlement   Even the new White House report  buttressed in part     by the non partisan and professional General Accounting Office  shows     that Iraq is getting a failing grade in its ability to meet key military     and political metrics on its path toward reconciliation and stability  The Administration cites the positive developments     in Anbar Province as justification for continuing this perpetual     deployment of American forces  There has been progress there  much of     it pre dating the so called surge  Hundreds of members of the Vermont     National Guard know how bad the situation was in Anbar less than a year     and a half ago  when these soldiers helped make up Task Force Saber in     Ramadi  They were in the worst place in Iraq at the worst time  Since     then the situation has clearly improved  and our troops and their     commanders deserve credit and our thanks for that that tough and     dangerous work   But the new found calm is based on a set of     agreements between Sunni tribes and American forces  not with the Iraqi     Government  The Iraqi Government sees newly organized and perhaps newly     armed groups of Sunnis as a threat to its power  and it is doubtful that     will change any time soon   In the meantime  the situation elsewhere continues     to implode   Passage of the Feingold Amendment would force the     Iraqis  and neighboring nations with a stake in Iraqs future  to     recognize that the open ended deployment of U S  forces is ending  The     draw down of our forces  coupled with a strong U S  led diplomatic     initiative  might bring about the political reconciliation that no     amount of additional military force can bring about   It might also cause Iraqs warring ethnic factions     to go their own way  splitting the country into separate states  But     that is where they are currently headed anyway  The Administrations     policies and incompetence have brought us to the point where there are     no good options  But either of these scenarios is better than the     future offered by the President  His war is costing us horrific     casualties and enormous sums that could be better spent repairing our     frayed international reputation and strengthening our security at home      I urge my colleagues to take the only responsible     step and pass this amendment that will finally bring our troops home
