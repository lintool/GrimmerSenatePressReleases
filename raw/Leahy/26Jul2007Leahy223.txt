       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Internally Displaced Persons In   Colombia                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    On    Internally Displaced Persons In Colombia Mr  LEAHY  At a time when we are focused on the     chaos in Iraq and the flood of Iraqis who have fled their homes and are     living either as displaced persons in Iraq or as refugees in Jordan      Syria and elsewhere  I want to call attention to a humanitarian crisis     in our own hemisphere   In Colombia  a country of roughly 44 million people  over 3 million     have been internally displaced as a result of political and drug related     violence and the aerial spraying of chemical herbicides to eradicate     coca  They are the second largest displaced population in the world     after Darfur  Sudan  An average of 18 000 Colombians are uprooted every     month  with more than 1 million forced to flee in the past five years     alone  according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees      To put that in perspective  if the same ratio were     applied to the United States  a country of roughly 300 million people      there would be over 20 million internally displaced Americans  That is     a staggering number when you consider the burden they would place on     public services and the environment  Colombia by comparison is a     relatively poor country  and many of these people  the majority of whom     are women and children  lack access to basic health care  sanitation      education  adequate shelter  or employment   It is my understanding that Colombia has suitable     laws for addressing the needs of the internally displaced  but the laws     are too often ignored or poorly implemented  Insecurity and inadequate     public services in isolated areas  where many of the displaced are     located  hinder return to their homes and contribute to further     displacement   Recently  the House of Representatives passed a     resolution calling on the Colombian Government and the international     community to prioritize the needs of displaced persons  and recommending     that the United States increase funding for emergency and long term     assistance   The Senate version of the fiscal year 2008 State      Foreign Operations bill provides  40 million for assistance for     displaced persons in Colombia  This is a  5 million increase above the     Presidents budget request  which was woefully inadequate  As the White     House urges Congress to continue funding aerial eradication programs     which  despite billions of dollars  have failed to make an appreciable     dent in the amount of coca under cultivation  one would like to think     that at some point they will exhibit the same zeal for meeting the basic     needs of Colombias most vulnerable people
