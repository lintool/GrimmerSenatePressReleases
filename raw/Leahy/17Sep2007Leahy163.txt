       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  On The Introduction Of The Habeas   Corpus Restoration Act As An Amendment To The National Defense Authorization Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt       Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee      On The Introduction Of Amendment 2022     The Habeas Corpus Restoration Act Of 2007     To H R  1585  The National Defense Authorization Act  September 17  2007    Last year  Congress committed an historic mistake     by suspending the Great Writ of habeas corpus  not just for those     confined at Guantanamo Bay but for millions of legal residents in the     United States  The Senate Judiciary Committees hearing in May on this     bill illustrated the broad agreement among representatives from diverse     political beliefs and backgrounds that the mistake committed in the     Military Commissions Act of 2006 must be corrected  The Habeas Corpus     Restoration Act of 2007  S 186  the bill on which this amendment is     based  has 30 cosponsors  The Senate Judiciary Committee     reported it on a bipartisan basis  I hope Senators will review the     Committee report on this measure   Habeas corpus was recklessly undermined in last     years Military Commissions Act  Like the internment of Japanese     Americans during World War II  the elimination of habeas rights was an     action driven by fear  and it was a stain on Americas reputation in the     world  This is a time of testing  Future generations will look back to     examine the choices we made during a time when security was too often     invoked as a watchword to convince us to slacken our defense of liberty     and the rule of law      The Great Writ of habeas corpus is the legal process that guarantees an     opportunity to go to court and challenge the abuse of power by the     Government  The Military Commissions Act rolled back these protections     by eliminating that right  permanently  for any non citizen labeled an     enemy combatant  In fact  a detainee does not have to be found to be an     enemy combatant  it is enough for the Government to say someone is     awaiting determination of that status   The sweep of this habeas provision goes far beyond     the few hundred detainees currently held at Guantanamo Bay  and it     includes an estimated 12 million lawful permanent residents in the     United States today  These are people who work and pay taxes  people     who abide by our laws and should be entitled to fair treatment  Under     this law  any of these people can be detained  forever  without any     ability to challenge their detention in court       This is wrong  It is unconstitutional  It is un American   Top conservative thinkers  evangelical activists      and prominent members of the Latino community have all spoken out on the     need to restore these basic American rights  General Colin Powell  like     many leading former military and diplomatic officials  has spoken of the     importance of these habeas rights  He asked  Isnt that what our     systems all about  Perhaps most powerful for me was the testimony of     Rear Admiral Donald Guter  who was working in his office in the Pentagon     as Judge Advocate General of the Navy on September 11  2001  and saw     first hand the effects of terrorism  His credibility is unimpeachable     when he says that denying habeas rights to detainees endangers our     troops and undermines our military efforts  Admiral Guter testified  As we limit the rights     of human beings  even those of the enemy  we become more like the     enemy  That makes us weaker and imperils our valiant troops  serving     not just in Iraq and Afghanistan  but around the globe           He was right  Whether you are an individual soldier  or a great Nation      it is difficult to defend the higher ground by taking the lower road      The world knows what our enemies stand for  The world also knows what     this country has tried to stand for and live up to  in the best of     times  and the worst of times           Now  as we work to reauthorize the many programs that compose our     valiant armed forces  it is the right time to heed the advice of so many     of our top military lawyers who tell us that eliminating basic legal     rights undermines our fighting men and women  it does not make them     stronger            I am proud to call up our amendment  Senate Amendment 2022  which now     has 19 cosponsors  and seek its immediate consideration            Mr  President  I especially want to thank Senator Specter and     acknowledge his strong and consistent leadership on this issue  Senator     Specter and I came to this floor to offer this amendment back on July     10  when this bill was initially being considered  and thereafter  I     hope all Senators will now join with us in restoring basic American     values and the rule of law  while making our Nation stronger           It is from strength that America should defend our values and our way of     life  It is from the strength of our freedoms  our Constitution  and     the rule of law that we shall prevail  I hope all in the Senate      Republicans and Democrats  will join us in standing up for a stronger     America  for the America we believe in  and support the Habeas Corpus     Restoration Act of 2007
