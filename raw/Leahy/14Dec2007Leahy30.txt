       Leahy s National Guard Empowerment Reforms Clear Congress                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                  Leahys National       Guard Empowerment Reforms Clear Congress    Giving Guard A       Voice In Key Decisions   On Equipment        Missions And Manpower      Leahy Also Wins       Repeal Of Year Old Law That Made It Easier   For President To       Take Over Guard And Declare Martial Law      WASHINGTON  Friday  Dec  14   The       U S  Senate Friday passed and sent to the Presidents desk a       defense policy bill that includes key victories for the National       Guard  including giving the Guard more bureaucratic muscle at       the Pentagon in decision making about the Guards missions        equipment and staffing  The President is expected to sign the       bill  which also cleared the House earlier in the week         The bill also will       repeal the so called Insurrection Act Rider  attached to last       years defense policy bill  which has made it easier for       Presidents to take control of the National Guard from governors       and to use the U S  military for domestic law enforcement        Earlier this year  key national military and law enforcement       officials testified against last years changes in a Senate       Judiciary Committee hearing organized by Leahy  Both the Guard       Empowerment provisions and the legislation to repeal the       changes to the Insurrection Act are drawn from two bills       introduced by Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and Sen  Kit Bond        R Mo    the co chairs of the Senate National Guard Caucus        The defense policy       bill includes a variety of organizational reforms from the       Leahy Bond bill  including elevating the Chief of the National       Guard from the rank of Lt  General to the rank of General        making the Chief the prime military advisory to the Defense       Secretary and to the Joint Chiefs  raising the status of the       National Guard Bureau  forging a stronger relationship between       the Guard and the Northern Command  and directing the Pentagon       to work with the Guard in planning on homeland defense       The National Guard       is a 21st Century military       organization  coping with a 19th Century Pentagon       organization chart  said Leahy  These reforms will clear away       organizational cobwebs to give the Guard a bigger say about the       Guards future  Right now the Guard has to beg and      scrape and rely       on the tender mercies of others for every piece of equipment       they need to do the jobs they are asked to do  These reforms       will begin changing that                              Statement Of U S  Senator       Patrick Leahy  Fiscal Year 2008 Defense       Authorization Bill Conference Report  National Guard       Empowerment  December 14  2007     Mr  President  the Conference       Report on the Fiscal Year 2008 Department of Defense       Authorization Bill now before the Senate includes some       significant mileposts of progress for the National Guard  Those       sections of the bill come directly from the National Guard       Empowerment Act of 2007  a bill that I sponsored along with       Senator Kit Bond of Missouri  my fellow co chair of the U S       Senate National Guard Caucus  Well over half of the Senate    a       significant portion of the National Guard Caucus    cosponsored       the Empowerment Bill  Working with the Nations Governors  key       National Guard affiliated organizations  and the Adjutants       General of the United States  we make notable headway in this       bill on several issues that go to the core of the Guards       missions  preparedness and our national defense         This legislation clears away       organizational cobwebs in the Department of Defense and changes       the Pentagons structure to better reflect the vital role and       responsibilities of the Guard  More importantly  we direct the       Department of Defense to begin the urgently needed process of       tapping into the National Guards extensive experience in       homeland defense issues  expertise the Defense Department has       previously ignored        To give the Guard more       bureaucratic muscle  especially in decisions affecting the       Guard  the legislation elevates the Chief of the National Guard       from the rank of Lieutenant General to the rank of General        making the Chief the prime military advisor to the Secretary of       Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  The       National Guard Bureau becomes what is called a Joint Activity        still closely affiliated with the Department of the Army and the       Air Force  but now more like other joint agencies like Combatant       Commands and the Defense Intelligence Agency  capable of       communication across the Department        To focus the Defense Department       more on homeland defense  the bill requires that the Deputy       Commander of the U S  Northern Command come from the ranks of       the National Guard  and it requires the Department of Defense to       develop a plan in conjunction with the Guard to deal with       homeland defense situations        These reforms are tangible       progress for the Guard  and there is a pressing need for them        The National Guard is a keystone to our nations defense  ready       to carry out missions at home and abroad  The Guard is ready to       serve as the primary reserve to both the Army and the Air Force        while taking the lead in providing military support during       emergencies situations at home  It would take a long time even       only to list the missions accomplished by the National Guard       since September 11th in carrying out their       assignments in Iraq and Afghanistan or to respond to natural       disasters like Hurricane Katrina       Despite all the Guards       achievements on our behalf  the force often has gotten       second class treatment in the Department of Defense  The Guard       has to beg and scrape and rely on the tender mercies of others       for every piece of equipment they need to do the jobs they are       asked to do  and they have to fight to be included in the       long range planning and budget and policy discussions that       directly affect the Guard  its missions  its people  its       equipment and its other needs  The Guard works extremely       closely with state emergency responders  and they have special       authorities and experience in working within the domestic United       States  But despite this special expertise and these special       authorities  does the Pentagon listen to and learn from the       Guards ideas and knowledge about domestic defense  Sad but       true  the answer is no       I wish we could have gone even       further in this legislation  Dropped during floor debate here       in the Senate was a section of the Empowerment bill make the       Guard Bureau Chief a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  That       would improve the quality of advice to the Secretary of Defense       and the President on domestic defense matters  Another       provision  removed in conference with the House  would give the       Guard a separate budget for procuring homeland defense related       equipment  as well as the ability to work with states to       identify gaps in emergency response capabilities  Another       clearly warranted section of our bill would have ensured that       our Adjutants General  who command units from the both the Army       Guard and the Air Force Guard  receive joint credit for their       experience  That would create a greater pool of candidates for       the senior positions that we have opened up in this bill  The       institutional objections we heard to these provisions ranged       from the weak to the unreasonable  But regrettably  in this       case they carried the day       We did make clear progress  The       Joint Activity provision  to take a less prominent example  is       highly significant  The phrase Joint Activity means exactly       how it is used in the Goldwater Nichols Act  an organization       that performs joint missions under the auspices of the Office of       the Secretary of Defense  the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of       Staff  or the commander of a Combatant or a Combined Command        The National Guard Bureau has now basically been given a legal       license to work not only with the two services    the Army and       Air Force    but also with a variety of unified commands  the       Joint Staff  and the Office of the Secretary of Defense  The       National Guard Bureau now will have similar organizational       standing as that granted to other joint activities such as        among many other organizations  the Joint Staff or the Defense       Logistics Agency       This coalition of National Guard       supporters    which goes far beyond the sponsors and co sponsors       to the Governors  the Associations  and many others    must keep       pushing  If we are to have a national security structure that       is as effective as the American people need and deserve it to       be  we must ensure that the Guards voice is heard loud and       clear in key deliberations  We must ensure that the Pentagon       takes the military support mission seriously  We should       consider re introducing the portions of the Empowerment       legislation that have not yet been enacted  To keep a       laser like focus on domestic defense  we must take a careful       look at other Defense Department organizations involved in       domestic defense  like U S  Northern Command       I know that Senator Bond joins me       in thanking the Nations Governors for their stalwart support of       the Empowerment Bill  as well their unstinting energy in working       with us on another successful effort on behalf of the Guard  the       similarly successful effort to repeal the recent changes to the       Insurrection Act  turning back an unjustifiable expansion of a       Presidents power to use the military for law enforcement  This       provision of this Defense Authorization Bill was drawn directly       from legislation that I introduced with Senator Bond  which this       year was the subject of a hearing by the Judiciary Committee             Associations like the Adjutants       General Association of the United States  the National Guard       Association of the United States  and the Enlisted Association       of the National Guard of the United States were there every step       of the way  keeping their members informed and bringing enormous       energy to this effort        Special thanks go to       Representatives Gene Taylor of Mississippi and Tom Davis of       Virginia who led a vigorous  companion effort on the House side        as well as Senators Carl Levin of Michigan  John McCain of       Arizona  and John Warner of Virginia for leading the Senate       negotiations        We owe the deepest thanks to the       almost 500 000 members of the National Guard  Their ability to       balance their full time jobs with their family responsibilities       and Guard commitments is simply remarkable  They are       indispensable to our national security structure  at home  and       abroad  Their sense of pride  professionalism and duty       represents the very best qualities of our military and our       country  I am simply in awe of what they have done to protect       this Nation  and I know the whole Congress and the country share       this heartfelt gratitude        Throughout this whole process  we       have been guided by the fact that the Guard is always there for       the people of the United States of America  Our part is easier       than theirs  We cannot afford to let our Guard down  The Guard       Empowerment provisions of this bill will help us honor that       commitment to the men and women of the Guard
