       Showdown Looms As Congress Nears Final Vote On Major Expansion Of Health   Insurance For Kids                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                 Showdown Looms As      Congress Nears Final Vote     On Major Expansion Of Health Insurance For Kids        Leahy  Sanders  Welch Announce Breakthrough     That Would Rescue More Than 2000 Vermont Children     Who Face Insurance Cutoffs Under Bush Plan       While Covering Thousands More Under Dr  Dynasaur  WASHINGTON  Tuesday  Sept  25          Congress is on the verge of passing a major childrens health bill      that will protect insurance coverage for kids currently enrolled in      the State Childrens Health Insurance Program  SCHIP  and provides      new funding to cover millions of kids without insurance  The      Vermont Congressional Delegation  Sen  Patrick Leahy  D   Sen       Bernie Sanders  I   and Rep  Peter Welch  D   announced Tuesday      that the bill would save health insurance for more than 2000 Vermont      children who now are about to lose coverage under new rules      announced by the Bush Administration  while enabling coverage of      thousands more Vermont kids    The House and Senate are expected to      approve the bipartisan SCHIP bill in final votes this week       President Bush has threatened a veto   Using SCHIP funds  Vermonts Dr       Dynasaur program now offers comprehensive health coverage to      children from households with incomes up to 300 percent of poverty          61 950 for a family of four  Eleven other states also offer      coverage to kids from middle income families  The legislation will      cover an additional 4 million children nationwide  several thousand      more in Vermont    on top of the 6 million currently in the      program  It will also sideline a pending Bush Administration rule      change  announced Aug  17  that threatens to cut coverage for      millions of kids now covered under SCHIP  That change would tighten      restrictions on states like Vermont that cover children above 250      percent of the federal poverty level  In Vermont  the new rules      would mean more than 2000 kids would lose their health coverage    The bipartisan bill also fends off      another sudden Bush Administration change announced this summer that      would cost Vermont more than  20 million each year  by barring      states like Vermont from using Medicaid funds for rehabilitation      services for students with disabilities in kindergarten through the      12th grade  The Vermont Delegation opposes the rules      change  and Leahy and Sanders helped convince Senate leaders to      include a six month moratorium in the bill   Leahy said  We can make sure that ten      million children have health insurance for what the Bush      Administration spends in Iraq in just 41 days  But instead of      helping more families that are struggling  the President would cut      thousands in Vermont who have coverage right now  He is failing to      lead  so Congress again is stepping in to realign our priorities   Sanders said  We are not only      stopping President Bush from reducing coverage for more than 2 000      Vermont children  we are adding more kids to the program all over      the country  We also are moving closer to the day when all of our      children have health insurance  The Presidents threat to veto this      bill is incomprehensible   Welch said  Vermont has shown the      nation that providing health care to kids is inexpensive and the      right thing to do  This legislation eliminates the Bush      Administrations road block to Vermonts successful Dr  Dynasaur      program and gives millions of working parents across the country the      peace of mind that comes with knowing their child can see a doctor      when he or she is sick  I am hopeful that Congress will approve      this bill with a strong enough majority that sends a clear message      to President Bush  Dont mess with health care for kids
