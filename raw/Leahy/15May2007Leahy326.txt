       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On National Peace Officers Memorial Day                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy   On National Peace Officers Memorial Day   May 15  2007 Today marks the 26th year that peace    officers from around the country have gathered in the Nations Capital to    participate in the National Peace Officers  Memorial Day Service  Every    year  Peace Officers Memorial Day offers the people of the United States  in    their communities  in their State capitals  and in the Nations Capital  the    opportunity to honor and reflect on the extraordinary service and sacrifice    given year after year by our police forces  I welcome the visiting peace    officers and their family members who are gathered in Washington today as we    honor their services and those lost this past year   Earlier this month  the Senate passed a resolution    marking today National Peace Officers Memorial Day  This is now the    eleventh year running that I have sponsored this resolution to honor the    sacrifice and commitment of those law enforcement officers who give their    lives serving their communities  Senator Specter  himself a former    prosecutor  former Chairman of the Judiciary Committee  and now our ranking    member  was the lead Republican sponsor of this bipartisan measure this    year  I thank the Majority Leader  himself a former police officer  and all    Senators for their support in recognizing the sacrifices that law    enforcement officers make each day for the American people  Currently  more than 900 000 men and women who guard    our communities do so at great risk  After the hijacked planes hit the    World Trade Center in New York City on September 11  2001  72 peace officers    died while trying to ensure that their fellow citizens in those buildings    got to safety  That act of terrorism resulted in the highest number of    peace officers ever killed in a single incident in the history of our    country  and is a tragic reminder of how important it is for the Congress to    provide all of the resources necessary to protect officers in the line of    duty   Since the first recorded police death in 1792  there    have been more than 17 900 law enforcement officers who have made the    ultimate sacrifice  We are fortunate in Vermont that we rank as the State    with the fewest officer deaths  With 19 deaths  however  that is of course    19 deaths too many   In 2006  145 law enforcement officers died while    serving in the line of duty  below the decade long average of 165 deaths    annually  and a drop from 2005 when 156 officers were killed  That is still    145 officers too many  We need to continue our support for better equipment    and the increased use of bullet resistant vests  improved training  and    advanced emergency medical care  I hope as the 110th Congress    moves forward that all Senators can work together to ensure that all of our    law enforcement officers and their families have the full support and the    resources they need from the Federal Government   I have been working to help make it safer on the beat    for our officers  Back in 1998  Senator Campbell and I authored the    Bulletproof Vest Grant Partnership Act  in part a response to the tragic    Carl Drega shootout on the Vermont New Hampshire border in which two state    troopers who lacked bulletproof vests were killed  Since then  we have    successfully reauthorized this program three times  In the Bulletproof Vest    Partnership Grant Act of 2000  in the State Justice Institute    Reauthorization Act of 2004  and most recently as part of the Violence    Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005  It is    now authorized at  50 million per year through Fiscal Year 2009 to help    State  tribal and local jurisdictions purchase armor vests for use by law    enforcement officers  Senator Specter and I joined together to send a    letter to other Senators last week to make sure that the Bulletproof Vest    Partnership grant program is fully funded this year  Bulletproof vests have    saved the lives of thousands of officers and are a fundamental line of    defense that no officer should be without  It is crucial that Congress    provide the full funding authorized to the Bulletproof Vest Partnership    program  Hundreds of thousands of police officers and local jurisdictions    are counting on us  I am disappointed that not all of Congresss actions to    protect and help our law enforcement officers are implemented by this    Administration  President Bush has repeatedly proposed drastic cuts to the    bulletproof vest initiative and other grant programs that directly assist    State and local law enforcement  The Bush Administration has spent more    than  400 billion on a failed policy in Iraq  and yet the President    continues to propose cuts in funding for programs here in the United States    for first responders who protect our Nations communities   I will mention one other important example of a law I    sponsored and helped pass in 2003  the Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefit    Act  This important  bipartisan legislation reflects the belief of Congress    that the families of firefighters  law enforcement officers  and other first    responders should be cared for when a public safety officer dies of a heart    attack or stroke in the line of duty  To date  the Department of Justice    has made only two positive determinations from the more than 230    applications it has received  It is inexcusable that the Department of    Justice appears to be interpreting this law as narrowly as possible and is    denying and delaying so many of these claims  Congress and the American    people want to see fair and equitable treatment for the families of the    brave individuals who lose their lives in the line of duty  not    foot dragging and excuses from the Justice Department  We can all agree that the men and women in law    enforcement who have sacrificed for our safety deserve our deep gratitude    and respect  National Peace Officers Memorial Day recognizes real life    heroes  Our Nations law enforcement officers deserve our commitment to    provide for those who help keep us all safe  I support and respect our    State and local police officers and all of our first responders  and am    proud to recognize their role in upholding the rule of law and keeping our    Nation safe and secure
