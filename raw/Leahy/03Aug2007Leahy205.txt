       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Assistance For Ethiopia                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     Assistance For Ethiopia    August 3  2007 Mr  LEAHY  After the overthrow of Ethiopias     brutal former Prime Minister Mengistu  Prime Minister Meles Zenawi     ushered in a period of hope and optimism  On May 15  2005  Ethiopia     held its first open multi party elections  The international community     praised the people of Ethiopia for an astounding 90 percent voter     participation rate  an encouraging beginning to a new political process      The Ethiopian people deserve a democratic process in which opposition     parties can organize and participate  and journalists can publish     freely  without fear of arrest or retribution  Unfortunately  as it     turned out  the 2005 election was not the turning point many had hoped     for   Early polls suggested the opposition Coalition for     Unity and Democracy Party would make gains in the Ethiopian Parliament     that could threaten the control of Prime Minister Meles ruling     Ethiopian People s Revolutionary Democratic Front  These reports were     followed by credible allegations of manipulation of the vote counting     process  When the government finally announced results that assured its     continued hold on power  thousands of people took to the streets in     protest  The police arrested over 30 000 people and some 193 people     were killed  Although most of the protestors were released soon after     their arrest  70 opposition leaders and journalists remained in prison       Following these events  I wrote to Ethiopias     Ambassador Kassahun Ayele and officials at the State Department to     express my concern with the imprisonment of the Ethiopian politicians      Human rights organizations and other international figures condemned the     detentions and urged Prime Minister Meles to release them  These     efforts were to no avail   Some detainees remained in jail for over two years     before being brought to trial in a manner that was incompatible with     international standards of justice  Last month  they were convicted of     such vague charges as outrage against the constitution and inciting     armed opposition  They were stripped of their rights to vote and to     run for public office  Several were sentenced to life in prison      Nothing was done to prosecute the police officers who fired on the     protesters  The situation had gone from bad to worse   Then suddenly  less than two weeks ago  the     Ethiopian Government announced the pardon and release of 38 opposition     leaders  I am pleased that Prime Minister Meles heeded the pleas of the     Ethiopian people and the international community and released these     prisoners  The fact is  none of them should have been arrested or tried     in the first place  Their release was long overdue and is welcome  I hope the government acts expeditiously to release     the remaining political detainees  and bring to justice police officers     who used excessive force  I also hope the negotiations that resulted in     the prisoners release will lead to further discussions between the     government and the leaders of the opposition  to ensure that their     political rights are fully restored and that future elections are not     similarly marred   While this news is positive  it comes at a time     when journalists and representatives of humanitarian organizations     report human rights abuses of civilians  including torture  rape and     extrajudicial killings  by Ethiopian security forces  including those     trained and equipped by the U S   in the Ogaden region   Congressman Donald Payne  Chairman of the     Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health  and a vocal defender of human     rights and democracy in Ethiopia  inserted into the Congressional Record     a June 18  2007  New York Times article that described these     abuses  This situation is also addressed in the Senate     version of the Fiscal Year 2008 State  Foreign Operations Appropriations     bill and report  which were reported by the Appropriations Committee on     July 10  The Appropriations Committee seeks assurance from the State     Department that military assistance for Ethiopia is being adequately     monitored and is not being used against civilians by units of Ethiopias     security forces  We need to know that the State Department is     investigating these reports  We also want to see effective measures by     the Ethiopian Government to bring to justice anyone responsible for such     abuses  Unfortunately  it appears that the Bush     administration has made little effort to monitor military aid to     Ethiopia  It is no excuse that the Ethiopian military has impeded     access to the Ogaden  as it has done  In fact  this should give rise to     a sense of urgency  If we cannot properly investigate these reports      and if the Leahy Law which prohibits U S  assistance to units of foreign     security forces that violate human rights is not being applied because     the U S  Embassy cannot determine the facts  then we should not be     supporting these forces   As if the allegations of human rights violations     were not enough  the New York Times reported on July 22 that the     Ethiopian military is blocking food aid to the Ogaden region  The     article also claimed that the military is siphoning off millions of     dollars intended for food aid and a UN polio eradication program  A     subsequent article on July 26 indicated that the World Food Program and     the Ethiopian Government have reached agreement  after weeks of     discussions  on a process for getting food aid through the military     blockade to civilians in the Ogaden region  But the same article also     reported that regional Ethiopian officials have expelled the Red Cross      Mr  President  during the Cold War we supported     some of the worlds most brutal  corrupt dictators because they were     anti communist  Their people  and our reputation  suffered as a     result  Now the White House seems to support just about anyone who says     they are against terrorism  no matter how undemocratic or corrupt  It     is short sighted  it tarnishes our image  and it will cost us dearly in     the long term   Prime Minister Meles has been an ally against     Islamic extremism in the Horn of Africa  for which we are grateful  But     there are serious concerns with Ethiopias U S  supported military     invasion of Somalia  It has led to some of the same problems associated     with the Bush Administrations misguided decision to invade Iraq without     a plan for leaving the country more stable and secure than before the     overthrow of Saddam  Iraqs partition now seems only a matter of time      and it is hard to be optimistic that Somalia a year from now will be any     more secure  or any less of a threat to regional stability  than before     the influx of Ethiopian troops   Ethiopia is also a poor country that has faced one     natural or man made disaster after another  and the U S  has responded     with hundreds of millions of dollars in humanitarian and other     assistance  We have a long history of supporting Ethiopia and its     people  and we want to continue that support  But our support to the     government is not unconditional  We will not ignore the unlawful     imprisonment of political opponents or the mistreatment of journalists      We will not ignore reports of abuses of civilians by Ethiopian security     forces
