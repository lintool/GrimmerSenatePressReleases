       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Nomination Of Norman Randy Smith   To The Ninth Circuit                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     On The Nomination Of Norman Randy Smith To The Ninth Circuit    February 15  2007 Today  we consider nominations for lifetime     appointments to the federal bench  including Judge Norman Randy Smith     to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit  Judge Smith has     nominated to a seat on the Ninth Circuit designated a judicial emergency     by the Administrative Office of the Courts  Judge Smiths nomination     easily could have been confirmed in the last Congressand the emergency     addressed many months agohad the Bush Administration chosen the     common sense approach it has now followed of nominating Judge Smithwho     is from Idahoto Idahos seat on the Ninth Circuit   Instead  the President picked a fight by insisting     on nominating Judge Smith to a California seat on the Ninth Circuit      Judge Smith had been nominated to fill the seat last occupied by Judge     Stephen Trott  an appointee from California who made a personal decision     to move to Idaho  I know of no precedent for shifting a circuit seat     based on a judges personal decision to change his or her personal     residence  That generated opposition from the California Senators and     created an impasse  I supported the California Senators  as I had     Senators Sarbanes and Mikulski in a similar circumstance when this     President sought to fill a Maryland seat on the Fourth Circuit with     someone from Virginia   I have tried for some time to get the President to     redesignate the Smith nomination and nominate him to fill the Idaho     vacancy  At long last  the President has done the right thing  The     White House finally changed course and the President nominated Judge     Smith for the Idaho seat on the Ninth Circuit  I thank the President     for finally doing the right thing   With the cooperation of the Senators from     California and the other Members of the Judiciary Committee  we were     able to avoid having a hearing on Judge Smiths nomination in this     Congress and to expedite his consideration  now that he has been     designated for the Idaho vacancy  We were able to report Judge Smiths     nomination last Thursday  Today  at long last  Senator Craig and     Senator Crapo and the people of Idaho will have a judge on this     important court from their home state   We have worked hard since convening this Congress     to make significant progress in our consideration of judicial     nominations  At our first executive business meeting  the Judiciary     Committee reported out five judicial nominations little more than two     weeks after they were sent to us  Three of these were for vacancies     determined by the Administrative Office of the U S  Courts to be     judicial emergencies  All five were among those returned to the     President without Senate action at the end of last year when Republican     Senators objected to proceeding with certain of the Presidents judicial     nominees in September and December last year  All five were confirmed     only three weeks after they were nominated  Last week  we reported another five nominations      including the nominations we consider today  We reported nominees from     the home states of Senator Specter and Senator Grassley and I want to     thank Senator Casey and Senator Brown for expediting their consideration     of nominees from their home states and approving them so quickly after     taking office  I have worked cooperatively with Members from both sides     of the aisle on our Committee  and in the Senate  to consider quickly     and report 10 judicial nominations so far this year  allowing us to fill     vacancies and improve the administration of justice in our nations     federal courts   With the five confirmations last week we have     confirmed more of President Bushs nominations in the 18 months I have     served as Judiciary Committee Chairman than in the more than two years     when Senator Hatch chaired the Committee with a Republican Senate     majority or during the entire last Congress with a Republican Senate     majority   With Judge Smiths confirmation today  we will have     confirmed a nomination to one of the Nations important circuit courts     little more than a month after the Republicans agreed to resolution     allowing the Senate to organize  That is more than the total of     President Clintons nominations to circuit court vacancies confirmed by     the Republican controlled Senate during the entire 1996 session  Today      with this one confirmation we will surpass the Republican total for an     entire session of the Congress   Last week  we also held the first judicial     nominations hearing of the new Congress and considered three more     nominees  two of whom are nominated to fill judicial emergency     vacancies  We held that hearing on February 6  When a Republican     chaired the Committee in 1999 and there was a Democratic President  the     first hearing on a judicial nominee was not held until June 16  We     could have postponed this hearing because it was at the same time as the     Senators briefing on the new National Intelligence Estimate about the     deteriorating situation in Iraq  As I did after 9 11  and after the     Senate buildings were shut down by the anthrax letters  I chose to go     forward with the nominations hearing  I know some on the other side of the aisle have     tried to raise a scare since I  again  became Chairman of the Judiciary     Committee  They rant as if the sky is falling and as if we would not     proceed on any judicial nominations  On the contrary  we have proceeded     promptly and efficiently   I have long urged the President to fill vacancies     with consensus nominees  After this weeks confirmations  according to     the Administrative Office of the U S  Courts there will be 51 judicial     vacancies  24 of which have been deemed to be judicial emergencies  Of     those 24 judicial emergency vacancies  the President has yet to send us     nominees for 17 of them  That means two thirds of the judicial     emergency vacancies are without a nominee from the President   We will continue moving forward efficiently as long     as the President sends us qualified  consensus nominees
