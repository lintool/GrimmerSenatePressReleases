       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Cluster Munitions Civilian   Protection Act Of 2007                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    On The Cluster Munitions Civilian Protection Act Of 2007    February 14  2007 Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  I am very pleased to cosponsor this     legislation on cluster munitions with my friend from California  Senator     Feinstein  I commend her for the determination she has shown to prevent     future harm to innocent people from these weapons   The problem of cluster munitions  which overwhelmingly maim and kill     civilians  has been known for many years  Perhaps the most egregious     example is Laos  where millions of these tiny explosives were dropped by     United States military aircraft during the Vietnam war  Over three     decades later they continue to cause horrific casualties among local     villagers and unsuspecting children   I have urged the Pentagon to address this problem for nearly a     decade   While they have acknowledged the problem  they have not yet taken     sufficient steps to solve it  We used large numbers of cluster munitions     in the invasion of Iraq  including in densely inhabited  urban areas      and many civilians paid and continue to pay a terrible price   Israel used these weapons extensively in Lebanon  including cluster     munitions supplied by the United States  and again it has been civilians     who have suffered disproportionately   Cluster munitions  like any weapon  have military utility  They can     be effective against armor or other military infrastructure  But they     are  in effect  indiscriminate  because they are scattered by the     thousands over wide areas   Many of them  between 1 and 40 percent depending on the type and the     condition of the terrain  fail to explode on contact and remain on the     surface of the ground as hazardous duds indefinitely  no different from     landmines   The duds are exploded by whoever comes into contact with them  Often     it is a child who thinks it is a toy  The consequences are     disastrous  lifelong disfigurement and disability  or death   No one suggests that it is possible to completely avoid civilian     casualties in war  Innocent casualties are an inevitable  tragic     consequence of all wars  But this legislation should not be necessary      Weapons that are so disproportionately hazardous to civilians should of     course be subject to strict controls on their use   The Feinstein Leahy bill does not prohibit the use or export of     cluster munitions  Rather  it would set a standard for reliability that     is the same as what the Pentagon now requires for new procurements of     these weapons   The President may waive this requirement if he certifies that doing     so is vital to protect the security of the United States  and he submits     a report describing the steps that will be taken to protect civilians     and the failure rate of the cluster munitions to be used or sold   Our bill  which is not aimed at any particular country because this     is a global problem  would also require that cluster munitions be used     only against military targets and not where civilians are known to be     present or in areas normally inhabited by civilians   This is a moral issue and it is an issue of our own self interest      Using or selling weapons that are so indiscriminate in their effect     without strict controls on their use is immoral  It is immoral   Anyone who has seen the horrific consequences of children with an arm     or a leg blown off  or a part of their face  or their lifeless body cut     to pieces by shrapnel  knows that   It is also contrary to our own interest to be using or selling     weapons which cause such appalling casualties of people who are not the     enemy  It fuels anger and resentment we can ill afford among the very     people whose support we need   Again  I am pleased to join with the Senator from California  This is     a thoughtful  much needed response to a serious humanitarian problem      It is also timely because other governments  following the leadership     of Norway  Austria and others  are meeting in Oslo later this month to     begin discussions on an international treaty to curtail the use and     export of cluster munitions that pose unacceptable risks to civilians      The United States should play a visible  constructive role in those     negotiations and it is our hope that this legislation will contribute to     that process
