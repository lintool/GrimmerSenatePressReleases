SEN. FEINGOLD COMMENTS ON STOPPING FLAWED FISA BILL FROM BEING JAMMED THROUGH THE SENATE
  Statement of U.S. Senator Russ Feingold 
  On Stopping the Flawed FISA Bill from Being Jammed
  Through the Senate
   "Today's vote against jamming a deeply flawed FISA bill through the Senate is a win for the American people and a rejection of the bullying tactics of the administration. We all agree that FISA needs to be updated so our government can go after the foreign communications of suspected terrorists. But we must not provide overly broad and unnecessary powers that infringe on the rights and privacy of law-abiding Americans, especially to an administration that has proven it cannot be trusted. I hope that Republicans will now allow the Senate to consider and vote on amendments to improve the FISA bill, such as adding privacy protections for Americans and stripping immunity for telecom companies that allegedly participated in the president's illegal warrantless wiretapping program."
