 Washington  D C    Today the Senate will vote on the latest Iraq resolution proposed by the Democrats   Senator John Ensign plans to vote  no  on the Democrats  proposal because it restricts our troops  abilities in combat to only  limited purposes    Ensign delivered a floor speech today when the Senate debated the resolution  and his remarks are included below      SENATOR JOHN ENSIGN    Floor Speech  March 15  2007    Mr  President  I rise this morning to speak about Senate Joint Resolution Nine and the consequences of failure in Iraq   I want to begin by reviewing just how Osama Bin Laden and al Qaeda see themselves achieving ultimate victory in Iraq      You don t have to be a serious student of history to realize that as of late  America has not exactly demonstrated the kind of collective will necessary to successfully complete military missions abroad       As a nation  it seems easy  maybe too easy  to commit ourselves through our military  into foreign lands in an attempt to accomplish what we believe is right  either to protect our vital national interests or to free a people from bondage  or in the case of Iraq to try to accomplish both       Whatever the reason for committing ourselves to a noble cause overseas  America ventures into another country with only the best of intentions  and for awhile the American people and her politicians overwhelmingly support our military and its mission       Then  when we see that victory is not as easy or as immediate as we had initially hoped  we start down a road of self doubt   We convince ourselves that our military mission was probably not all that important in the first place       We somehow twist our values to accommodate an opinion that our military expedition is not worth the effort we need to expend in order to be successful       We recoil once the realization hits us that lives and treasure are the coin of the realm when it comes to using our military to ensure our continued national security       And for too long our adversaries have witnessed this reluctance  this lack of will  to finish the task at hand   In 1982  America deployed her military to separate warring factions in Lebanon   We went in with only the best of intentions   People were being killed and it was up to us to  do something  about it       Then  on October 23  1983  two truck bombs detonated in buildings housing American forces in downtown Beirut  241 U S  Marines  sailors and soldiers lost their lives that day   Six months later America had had enough and we were out of Beirut       The Lebanese Civil war would rage on for another decade and during that time countless Lebanese  Palestinians  and Israelis would suffer as a result of our abdication of responsibility   As had always been the case before  our adversaries did not pursue us back to our shores to do us harm   But they did observe and they did note that the American public  led by her elected officials took the easy way out and departed before completing our intended mission       In 1993  the United States once again sought to  do something  to end a humanitarian crisis that was taking place on the African continent   In a country with no functioning central government  warlords ruled their individual pieces of territory within Somalia as personal fiefdoms       The Somali people were fodder as the warlords battled each other for control of land and resources   People were being killed   If they were not being killed by bullets  they were being starved to death       Although the situation in Somalia did not directly affect our national security  American leaders at that time answered the call to  do something  to alleviate the human suffering Americans were witnessing nightly as part of their television news shows and reading in the daily editorial columns of most big city newspapers       Our leaders once again answered the call by sending our young men and women in uniform to a foreign land to  fix things        Soon  our military had its mission expanded beyond providing humanitarian assistance       Part of this new mission involved capturing and or killing the Somali warlords responsible for the pain inflicted on their fellow citizens    As part of this new mission Army Rangers conducted an assault on Somali forces in what has come to be know as the  Black Hawk Down  incident       Here  two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down and 19 of our Rangers killed   In the days following  film footage was broadcast over and over again on television that showed the lifeless bodies of our soldiers being desecrated as they were dragged through the streets       This footage both shocked and humbled us   The support for our mission to do good things in Somalia quickly evaporated   The costs had become too great to bear       It was no longer that important to do the  right thing  and we subsequently withdrew our forces from the region       Once again  our adversaries watched as the world s superpower retreated from the fight   Today  Somalia continues to flounder as a failed state and a haven for Islamic radicalism on the eastern coast of Africa       In a 1998 interview with ABC s John Miller  Osama bin Laden said that the Clinton Administration s decision to withdraw from Somalia had emboldened his burgeoning al Qaeda force and encouraged him to plan new attacks       Our people realize d  more than before that the American soldier is a paper tiger that run s  in defeat after a few blows   the terror chief recalled   America forgot all about the hoopla and media propaganda and left dragging their corpses and their shameful defeat      And those attacks promised by bin Laden did come       On August 7  1998  Al Qaeda decided to test our mettle by simultaneously bombing our embassies in Tanzania and Kenya  and in the process killed 257 people and wounded over 4 000   Our tepid response once again gave Osama bin Laden comfort       Since the Clinton administration had chosen to treat terrorist attacks as law enforcement matters  America sought to prosecute in our courts those responsible   Osama bin Laden was soon placed atop the FBI s Ten Most Wanted List      Along with the 1993 World Trade Center bombing  the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia  and the 2000 attack on the USS COLE in Yemen  the Embassy Bombing was one of the major anti American terrorist attacks that preceded nine eleven     The United States responded to the embassy attacks by freezing financial assets of related parties and by firing some missiles into al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan       The attack in Afghanistan destroyed some physical targets   However  the operation did not accomplish the destruction of bin Laden and his operatives and did not lead to any significant changes in the al Qaeda network and leadership   Al Qaeda grew bolder  stronger  and more capable as we sat on our hands      And so  here we are today  facing an embolden enemy bent on our destruction who has convinced himself that he possesses the will to break our spirit   He s done it before and he s convinced he can do it again this time     The sad part about all this is that Osama bin Laden may very well be right this time   Today we stand here debating a resolution of appeasement that directly affects our military strategy in Iraq and  by default  our overall national security for years to come       This resolution calls for imposing an artificial timeline to withdraw our troops from Iraq  regardless of the conditions on the ground or the consequences of defeat  a defeat that will surely be added to what is unfortunately a growing list of American humiliations       I agree with the President s assessment that this legislation before us would hobble American commanders in the field and substantially endanger America s strategic objective of a unified federal democratic Iraq that can govern  defend  and sustain itself and be an ally in the war against Islamic fascism      The unintended consequence of this resolution is to bring to reality Osama Bin Laden s vision for Iraq  that after four years of fighting in Iraq the U S  Congress loses it s will to fight   We precipitously withdraw our forces and leave the fledgling Iraqi government to fend for itself  Sunni and Shia factions rip the nation apart at a scale previously unimaginable       There is a mass exodus of refugees out of Iraq  and no mechanism in place to deal with them   Iran  Syria  Saudi Arabia and other states in the region feel the need to get involved       This is a terrible scenario  but it is not the worst of scenarios   Bin Laden s nightmare vision also involves a chaotic Iraq with Sunni dominated areas like al Anbar province becoming a safe haven from which al Qaeda can launch attacks against the United States     And we could see the Shiite dominated areas  with the help of Iran  and its own oil wealth  be used as a terrorist breeding ground  as well   Make no mistake   The Iraqi situation is vastly different from Beirut  different from Somalia  and  different from the bombing of our African embassies       Iraq has consequences that will surely be felt here at home and around the world   If we leave Iraq before the job is done  as surely as night follows day  the terrorists will follow us home       I believe this   We will be sorry and we will regret having once again left unfinished our national security obligations   But by then it will be too late for regrets   We will find that as strong and powerful and compassionate as we think we are we can not  un ring  the bell   The damage will have been done      Osama Bin Laden and his al Qaeda followers are convinced that America is weak and decadent and they can succeed in grinding down our resolve and forcing us to retreat       Osama bin Laden has openly said  America does not have the stomach to stay in the fight    He is a murderer   He is a fanatic   He is an Islamic fascist   He is determined to destroy us and our way of life     Let us resolve today not to also make him a prognosticator of things to come   I urge my colleagues to reject this misguided legislation   We can not afford to leave this fight at this time   For the sake of America s future  we can not afford to fail     Mr  President  I yield the floor
