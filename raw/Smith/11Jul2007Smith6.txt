     United States Senator   Gordon Smith                                                                                                                                                                                         Contact  Phone             FLOOR SPEECH  Smith Calls for Glide Path Home for U S  Troops                 July 11th  2007   MR  SMITH  I come to the floor to speak for the Levin Reed amendment  I am the original Republican cosponsor of this proposal  I am proud to cosponsor this amendment because it calls for what I have been stating for 7 months  It sets up a timetable to draw down our troops    The amendment instructs the Secretary of Defense to transition U S  forces starting approximately 4 months from the enactment of this legislation through the spring of 2008  Further  this amendment explicitly outlines the role of the U S  military in Iraq as threefold  An appropriate amount of troops will remain to protect our diplomats  our military installations  and infrastructure  We will continue to train  equip  and provide logistical and intelligence support to the Iraqi security forces  sharing intelligence with them  Then  the third and most important point  We will be there to turn over every rock  every crevice  and seek out every al Qaida killer who wishes to harm Americans    Al Qaida is our mortal foe  This is the war on terror  for want of a better term  It is a war from which we cannot retreat    Over the past 7 months  when I spoke out pleading for a new course in Iraq  there has been a great cacophony of noise about how to go forward  Some of my colleagues have said to just cut off the funding  I have believed that to be dangerous and dishonorable  President Bush has said stay the course  and I find that troubling  What   stay the course   means is  we will continue to spend  12 billion a month  We will lose roughly three American soldiers a day  In addition to that  there will be countless wounded and maimed for life  for which I don t have a number    Underpinning the current course and the argument of many of my colleagues on this side of the aisle is the hope  the predicate  that at the end of the road there will be an Iraqi government that will govern effectively and democratically  I believe President Bush s formulation  that we will stand down when they can stand up  is backwards  I come to that conclusion  based on numerous trips to Iraq  that they will not stand up until we begin standing down    Like Senator McCain and many of my colleagues  I recently was in Iraq  To be with our troops is to be inspired  to be humbled in their presence because of the remarkable work they are doing and the cause for which they are fighting  As inspiring as that is  it is equally depressing  then  to meet with Iraqi political leaders  democratically elected  whom we think ought to be focused on reconciliation  What I have found is they are focused on revenge  What I have learned firsthand is that Americans have no comprehension of the complexity  the factionalism  and the intensity of hatred that exists in some parts of the Middle East  On top of the factionalism  there are ancient sectarian strifes which produced a low grade civil war that we cannot win  and which is not ours to win  It is theirs to win    As I said 7 months ago  there is no good option for how we come home  but it does seem to me that Senator Levin and Senator Reed best express my own conclusions  That is why I cosponsored their amendment  and that is to recognize al Qaida is our mortal foe  We must take them on where we can  But  ultimately  we have to get capable and effective Iraqi political leaders  too  so that they are pressured to do the most basic kinds of governing  establishing an oil revenue sharing law  debaathification  setting up local elections  allowing the processes of democracy to work  establishing a rule of law that gives people confidence  spending their oil revenue money for the restructuring and rebuilding of their own country  All of the money from the oil we are helping them pump sits in bank accounts  stuck by their Parliament    My fear is that what our presence and current posture are doing is simply keeping a civil war at a low grade level  Civil wars end in one of two ways  one side wins and the other loses  or they fight it out until they figure it out  My fear is that we delay the day for them figuring it out with our current posture  I would love to be proven wrong  I pray that President Bush is right  But I believe it is our obligation to have this debate to help change the course and the policy of the U S  Government and to help change the course and policy of the Iraqi Government  We cannot want democracy more for them than they want it for themselves  and what they seem bent on is an ethnic cleansing of their neighborhoods  a religious division  Ultimately  those are their decisions  not ours  But as long as we say we will take the bullet first  they will let us    I believe the Levin amendment provides a way forward with a responsible division of labor  Let the Iraqi forces that we have trained and equipped handle their security in Baghdad and in other communities  Let us help them by taking on al Qaida  The amendment envisions a much smaller American footprint  Our forces are trained and equipped in a way to handle that kind of mission  but as we speak  we are straining our military capacities and our personnel to a breaking point  I don t believe we should just abandon it  irrespective of consequences  That is why I urge my colleagues to look seriously at the Levin amendment  to consider it as the way forward that is both responsible as it relates to the Middle East and effective as it relates to the defense of the American people    So as a Republican  I am for the Levin amendment  I urge its adoption    I yield the floor                                                                                                                                        current Press Release
