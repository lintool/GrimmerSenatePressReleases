December 19  2005 Schumer  Clinton  Congressional Panel Backs  13 4 Million For Defense Projects to Benefit Central New York                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Schumer  Clinton  Defense Projects are Vitally Important for the New York Economy and National Security                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC    U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the joint House and Senate Conference Committee approved  13 4 million in the FY06 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill for defense projects to benefit Central New York  including  2 6 million for Rome Labs for their Cyber Situational Awareness and Enable Network Centric Warfare projects   5 million for Syracuse Research  s Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar Enhancement system   1 million for Cortland Cable  s Synthetic Material Arresting Gear Cable   1 8 million for Sensis Corporation  s Ground Air Task Oriented Radar  G ATOR   and  3 million for Lockheed Martin Syracuse  s TPS 59 HELRASR Support for US Ballistic Missile Defense Systems   The House has approved the bill and it must now get Senate approval before being sent to the President and signed into law             This is great news for Central New York   said Schumer   Additional funds will not only boost the area economy  but also put the Central New York and New York State at the forefront of defense technology  As the men and women of our military bravely serve our country all over the world  the funding for these Central New York defense projects will vastly improve national security technology and will give our armed forces an even greater edge          Central New York has already proven to the world its leadership in cutting edge defense research and technology   Senator Clinton said   This new funding will help protect our troops  both at home and abroad  and is an important investment in our local companies and the communities they support     5 million of the federal funding will go to the Syracuse Research Corporation for the development of Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar Enhancement  LCMR   The funding will create new opportunities to improve and enhance national security  The radar  developed for the Special Operations Command  SOCOM  and currently in theater  provides the capability to automatically locate mortar firing positions by detecting and tracking the mortar shell  then backtracking to the weapon position  Accordingly  this technology will allow soldiers in combat to more effectively take cover from mortar fire  locate its origin  and respond  LCMR systems have already been deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan  Funding in this legislation would upgrade these systems  SRC received  2 5 million of federal funding for the LCMR in FY 05          2 5 million of the federal funding will go to Rome Air Force Research Laboratory   1 million will go to AFRL  s Cyber Situational Awareness technology project and  1 6 million to the Enable Network Centric Warfare project  The funding for the Cyber Situational Awareness will be used in developing Cyber Course of Action Tools  which deal with determining appropriate fine grain  automated defensive responses to adversary information warfare attacks and developing sensor fusion  which is concerned with fusing the information collected by sensors in order to create a consistent  comprehensive picture of what is occurring at all levels of a military operation        Federal funding for Enable Network Centric Warfare would support efforts to develop  integrate  and demonstrate enhanced airborne networking capabilities in support of Network Centric operations  Funding will be used to accelerate the evolution of airborne networking technologies  providing both an immediate improvement to current warfighting capabilities  as well as forming the basis for enabling future airborne network centric capabilities    1 million in federal funding will also go to Cortland Cable for the development of Synthetic Material Arresting Cable  and is anticipated to have a positive employment impact  The funding supported under this request will continue previously funded efforts to investigate the use of lightweight  synthetic materials and novel cable construction to replace the steel cables that recover aircraft aboard U S  Navy Aircraft Carriers  Synthetic cables could improve the factor of safety of the entire system by 60   Because the strength to weight of synthetic materials is 4 5 times better than steel  system inertia is significantly reduced  enabling the arresting gear to apply breaking force much earlier  The use of synthetic cable also possesses a potential weight savings of 62 tons per carrier and increase arresting gear performance by 25   Cortland Cable received  1 million in FY 05         1 8 million in federal funding will go to Sensis Corporation Ground Air Task Oriented Radar  G ATOR  Engineering Development Model   The G ATOR program is a single material solution for the Multi Role Radar System  MRRS  and Ground Weapons Locator Radar  GWLR  requirements  G ATOR replaces and consolidates the capability of numerous legacy radars  including the AN TPS 63 air surveillance  AN MPQ 62 force control  AN TPS 73 air traffic control and AN UPS 3 air defense radar systems   Funding under this request will be used in the development of the G ATOR prototype   Current radar performance does not meet operational forces requirements  Failure to support this initiative delays seizing the moment in taking advantage of technological breakthroughs  The lapse jeopardizes operational forces from having the technological advantage in detecting  identifying  and classifying threats on the battlefield  The consequences could potentially allow opposing forces to gain air and ground superiority in future operational areas            3 million in federal funding will go to Lockheed Martin MS2 Radar Systems for TPS 59 HELRASR Support for US Ballistic Missile Defense System   This funding will be used for systems engineering analysis  modifications  and test and evaluation of the TPS 59 against long range ballistic missiles including any opportunities to integrate the TPS 59 into MDA Integrated Flight Tests in 2006  The US Marine Corps TPS 59 is a 360 degree  tactically mobile  L band air and missile defense radar   The TPS 59 was upgraded by MDA  then BMDO  in the 1990  s to detect and track ballistic missiles and provide cues to missile defense weapon systems such as Patriot and AEGIS   The TPS 59 has successfully demonstrated it capabilities against various short range ballistic missiles and cruise missiles  including successful intercepts of these targets  The USMC is defining an upgrade of the TPS 59 antenna to reduce weight and increase mobility of the system under the HELRASR program   The HELRASR program currently has three years of design and development  driven largely by the funding profile   This effort would help bridge the requirements gap between the MDA and the USMC  greatly leveraging the production line startup of the TPS 59 and the engineering and development of HELRASR
