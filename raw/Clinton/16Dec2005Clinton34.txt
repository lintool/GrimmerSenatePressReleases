December 16  2005 Senators Clinton  Lieberman and Bayh Introduce Federal Legislation to Protect Children From Inappropriate Video Games                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Click here to view the video of Senator Clinton s remarks  Washington  DC    With just over a week left in the holiday gift shopping season   Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  Joe Lieberman and Evan Bayh  joined by parents  advocates and experts  introduced legislation designed to prohibit the sale of inappropriate video games to children   In unveiling the bill  the Senators underscored that video game content is getting increasingly violent and sexually explicit  yet young people are able to purchase these games with relative ease and parents are struggling to keep up with being informed about the content   The Senators emphasized that their legislation will put teeth in the enforcement of video game ratings  helping parents protect their children from inappropriate content   They were joined in making the announcement by April DeLaney  Director of the Washington Office for Common Sense Media  Norman Rosenberg  President and CEO of Parents Action for Children and Dr  Michael Rich  Director of the Center on Media and Child Health at Children s Hospital in Boston and Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School  in a show of support for the legislation            The holiday season is a particularly important time to raise awareness of this issue   Video games are hot holiday items  and there are certainly wonderful games that help our children learn and increase hand and eye coordination  However  there are also games that are just not appropriate for our nation  s youth     said Senator Clinton     This bill will help empower parents by making sure their kids can  t walk into a store and buy a video game that has graphic  violent and pornographic content              The content of many cutting edge games is becoming more and more vivid  violent  and offensive to our most basic values   Lieberman said    We are not interested in censoring videos meant for adult entertainment but we do want to ensure that these videos are not purchased by minors  Our bill will help accomplish this by imposing fines on those retailers that sell M rated games to minors  putting purchasing power back in the hands of watchful parents             Many parents are being stretched thin trying to provide a good life for their children while protecting them from a coarsening culture     Senator Bayh said     Our legislation will give parents a hand by requiring retailers to abide by the ratings that are meant to keep children from purchasing violent video games             The Clinton Lieberman Bayh bill  the Family Entertainment Protection Act  prohibits any business from selling or renting a Mature  Adults Only  or Ratings Pending game to a person who is younger than seventeen  On site store managers would be subject to a fine of  1 000 or 100 hours of community service for the first offense   5 000 or 500 hours of community service for each subsequent offense   The bill also requires an annual  independent analysis of game ratings and requires the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  to conduct an investigation to determine whether hidden content like in Grand Theft Auto  San Andreas is a pervasive problem and take appropriate action   In addition  the bill will help ensure that consumers have a mechanism to file complaints with the FTC and that the FTC will report these complaints to Congress   Finally  the bill authorizes the FTC to conduct an annual  random audit of retailers to monitor enforcement and report the findings to Congress           Senator Clinton was motivated to take action on this issue when it was revealed in July that Rockstar Games had embedded illicit sexual content in the video game Grand Theft Auto  San Andreas   This game had received a Mature rating from the Entertainment Software Ratings Board  ESRB   which was unaware of the embedded content   When the content was revealed  Senator Clinton called on the FTC to investigate the source of the content and announced that she would work to develop legislation to address this problem   Senator Lieberman wrote to Rockstar games asking them to come clean on whether the material was embedded in the game   Rockstar Games subsequently recalled the game           Representative Joe Baca  CA   who has introduced legislation in the House to improve the video game ratings system  praised Senator Clinton for her involvement in this issue     I applaud Senator Clinton for introducing this legislation  and I look forward to working with her to help parents protect their children from exposure to inappropriate and harmful images              Illinois  Michigan  and California have all passed state laws to prohibit the sale of violent video games to minors           The following is a summary of the Clinton Lieberman Bayh legislation      Summary of The Family Entertainment Protection Act  SENATORS CLINTON LIEBERMAN BAYH    Consider the following scenario  You have been captured by a demented film maker who drops you into a gang infested slum  While the gangs think they are hunting you  they don  t know the real plot  that you are hunting them  while the director records each act of murder on film  Since you are outnumbered and could easily be mobbed  you cannot just jump in and fight everyone  Rather  you must be silent and patient  tracking your prey so that you can strike from behind  You strangle a villain with a sharp wire  and a finely rendered mist of blood sprays from his severed carotid artery         First Person Account of Manhunt from Time Magazine  2003    Video game content is getting more and more violent and sexually explicit  yet young people are able to purchase these games with relative ease    In its 2005  10th Annual MediaWise Video and Computer Game Report Card  The National Institute on Media and the Family found that retailers were more lenient in their selling practices this year compared to last   Boys as young as nine were able to purchase Mature rated games 42 percent of the time   At the same time  a majority of parents are feeling increasingly victimized by a culture of violence that makes it difficult to protect their children against influences they find to be inappropriate   This bill would help empower parents by putting them back in the driver  s seat  It would ensure that children can  t buy games the video game industry itself has determined to be inappropriate for them       I   Prohibition on Selling Mature and Adults Only video games to minors    The centerpiece of this bill is a prohibition against any business for selling or renting a Mature  Adults Only  or Ratings Pending game to a person who is younger than seventeen  On site store managers would be subject to a fine of  1 000 or 100 hours of community service for the first offense   5 000 or 500 hours of community service for each subsequent offense   This provision is not aimed at punishing retailers who act in good faith to enforce the Entertainment Software Ratings Board  ESRB  system  That  s why retailers would have an affirmative defense if they were shown an identification they believed to be valid or have a system in place to display and enforce the ESRB system  Similar prohibitions have become law in the last several months in California  Michigan  and Illinois       II   Annual Analysis of the Ratings System    Since the bill relies on the video game industry to continue rating the appropriateness of games for minors  this bill requires an annual  independent analysis of game ratings   This analysis will help ensure that the ESRB ratings system accurately reflects the content in each game and that the ratings system does not change significantly over time       III   Authority for the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  to Investigate Misleading Ratings    Part of the genesis of this bill was the revelation that the makers of Grand Theft Auto  San Andreas had included  through embedded code that was discovered and made accessible to the public  sexually explicit content inconsistent with the game  s Mature rating   This bill requires the FTC to conduct an investigation to determine whether what happened with GTA  San Andreas is a pervasive problem  It also includes a Sense of Congress that the Commission shall take appropriate action if it determines that there is a pervasive problem       IV  Authority to Register Complaints    This bill requires the Bureau of Consumer Protection  BCP  of the FTC to ensure that consumers can file complaints if they find content to be misleading or deceptive and requires the BCP to report on the number of such complaints to Congress        V   Annual Retailer Audit    This bill authorizes the FTC to conduct an annual  random audit of retailers    sometimes referred to as a secret shopper survey    to determine how easy it is for young people to purchase Mature and Adults Only video games and report the findings to Congress
