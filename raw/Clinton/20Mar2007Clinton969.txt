                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Washington  DC   At a press conference on Capitol Hill  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  and Wayne Allard  R CO  today joined with autism advocacy groups to unveil a new legislative initiative to expand access to treatment  interventions and support services for people with autism  The Expanding the Promise for Individuals with Autism Act  EPIAA  will provide initiatives and establish demonstration grant programs to enable people with autism and their families to live richer  fuller lives  Senators Clinton and Allard were joined by Bob Wright  Co Founder  Autism Speaks  Lee Grossman  President and CEO of the Autism Society of America  George Jesien  Executive Director  Association of University Centers for Disabilities and Alison Singer of Scarsdale  New York  parent and sibling of individuals with autism             It is a tragedy when children and adults with autism are not able to fully participate in their communities because they cannot access the services that would allow them to do so  The more we learn about autism  the more hope we have for treatment and the more tragic inaction becomes  This epidemic requires our smartest  best  comprehensive response and we must continue our efforts to provide treatment  care  greater research and understanding of autism spectrum disorder   said Senator Clinton           With more individuals being diagnosed with autism  and medical research demonstrating the importance of early intervention  I am pleased to support this bill  which will provide the critical funding and programs necessary to provide early diagnosis  treatment and services for autistic children  adults and their families   said Senator Allard           This bill specifically addresses the most critically important issue to the autism community today   obtaining appropriate services across the lifespan   said Lee Grossman  President and CEO of the Autism Society of America  ASA     Our families and individuals with autism are pleased that their voices have been heard by Senators Clinton and Allard  and encourage their Senate colleagues to support EPIAA            We thank Senator Clinton for her remarkable leadership in spearheading this legislation that has the potential to deliver real and meaningful change for millions of individuals and families impacted by autism   said Bob Wright  co founder of Autism Speaks           In the United States  one out of every 150 children has an autism spectrum disorder  and prevalence is on the rise   The range and severity of symptoms of autism vary from case to case  but symptoms often include difficulties in communicating  interacting with other individuals and sensory processing  The care involved in treating these symptoms often requires hours of intensive therapy every week   regimens that are often inaccessible to many families            The Clinton Allard bill will expand access to treatment  interventions and support services for people with autism and their families by        Establishing a Demonstration Grant Program to Assist States with Service Provision   The Clinton Allard bill will provide grants to states to help them provide evidence based treatments  interventions and services         Developing a Demonstration Grant Program for Adult Autism Services   While early diagnosis and intervention services are critical for children with autism  the need for intervention and services continues across the lifespan  To help address the needs of adults living with autism  the Clinton Allard bill will establish a demonstration grant program to help provide appropriate interventions and services to adults with autism   These grants will go to states to provide appropriate interventions and services  such as housing or vocational training  to adults with autism       Increasing Access to Services Following Diagnosis   Many children and families must wait months before gaining access to appropriate treatment after receiving a diagnosis of autism   To decrease this post diagnosis waiting period  the Clinton Allard bill will mandate that the Secretary of Health and Human Services develop guidelines to increase the amount and quality of post diagnosis treatments  interventions  and services  The guidelines will also eliminate delays in access to supplementary healthcare  behavioral support services  and individual and family support services through Federal and State funded programs        Increasing Support for Developmental Disabilities Centers of Excellence   Many families report difficulties in accessing services because of the limited number of health and education professionals who are trained to provide autism specific services  To increase the number of individuals across sectors that can provide adequate care and treatment services for individuals living with autism  the Clinton Allard bill will increase the capacity of University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities Education  Research and Service to train professionals in meeting the treatment  interventions and service needs of both children and adults living with autism        Examining Issues of Financing for Autism Services   The Clinton Allard bill will require the Government Accountability Office  GAO  to study the financing of autism treatment and services  including current public and private insurance coverage for autism treatment and support services  and identify geographic and regional disparities in access to care  The GAO will make recommendations as to how to finance treatment and care services to remove both cost and geographic barriers and attain a uniform baseline of coverage across the United States        Improving Protection and Advocacy Services   Last year  thousands of individuals with autism were unable to access already existing protection and advocacy services due to a lack of resources  The Clinton Allard bill will create a program to expand these services to assist individuals with autism and other emerging populations of individuals with disabilities to meet the growing need for advocacy services among individuals with autism       Improving Technical Assistance and Evaluation  The Clinton Allard bill will enable the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a National Technical Assistance Center for Autism Treatments  Interventions and Services to serve as a resource for parents and service providers  The organization will have experience in training  research translation  and service provisions  It will also analyze the grant programs under this Act and provide information about these programs to the public
