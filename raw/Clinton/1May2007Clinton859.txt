May 1  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the President s Veto of the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Washington  DC    With his veto today  President Bush has made it clear that he is standing in the way of ending the war in Iraq and bringing our troops home  The nation is ready for the President to stop disregarding the will of the American people and to work with Democrats on a funding bill that will enable us to begin redeploying our troops   He has a chance to do just that when he meets with the Democratic leadership tomorrow           It has been four years since the President declared an end to major combat operations  It is my hope that the President will approach this next round of talks in good faith            I am also disappointed that with his veto  the President has taken us back a step in meeting the homeland security needs of our high threat cities like New York City and vetoed  35 million in additional funding under the Urban Area Security Initiative           In addition  with his veto  the President has shirked his responsibility to address the growing health needs affecting those exposed to the toxic air around Ground Zero in the wake of 9 11 and vetoed  50 million in funding for 9 11 health  which would not only have helped provide treatment to those affected in the New York metro area  but also to responders from all over the country who are suffering from 9 11 health effects   This funding would have helped meet immediate health needs and allow 9 11 health programs to continue operating   Despite the President s actions today  I will continue to fight  along with my colleagues in the New York delegation  to secure the federal commitment and funding required to meet 9 11 health needs in the long term          The President has also chosen to veto critical legislation that would have ended the practice of giving Department of Homeland Security  DHS  contractors bonuses for incomplete or sub par work  thereby saving taxpayers millions of dollars                Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning the war in Iraq   Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning the health effects of 9 11
