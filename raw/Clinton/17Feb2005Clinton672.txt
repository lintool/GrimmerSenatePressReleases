                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Legislation Would Enact Sweeping Reforms by Next Major Election Cycle in 2006                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    WASHINGTON  DC   U S  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  and Barbara Boxer  D CA  today unveiled comprehensive voting reform legislation to make sure that every American is able to vote and every vote is counted  Senators Clinton and Boxer announced the legislation today in a press conference joined by Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones  D OH   who will sponsor the legislation in the House of Representatives  and voting rights advocates          Voting is the most precious right of every citizen  and we have a moral obligation to ensure the integrity of our voting process   said Senator Clinton   The smooth functioning of our democracy depends on voters having faith in the fairness and accuracy of our voting system  and the Count Every Vote Act is an important step toward restoring this covenant  We must be able to easily and accurately count every vote so that every vote counts          Added Senator Boxer   Every citizen of this country should be guaranteed that their vote matters  that their vote is counted  and that in the voting booth  their vote has a much weight as that of any CEO  any member of Congress  or any President  Our democracy is the centerpiece of who we are as a nation  and we must take action to ensure that the American people have full confidence in our electoral system          I am pleased to join with Senators Clinton and Boxer in introducing companion legislation in the House as we continue our efforts to ensure that every American is afforded their Constitutional right to vote   said Representative Tubbs Jones   This legislation seeks to combat the tremendous voting irregularities that plagued both the 2000 and 2004 elections  If in fact we see it is our obligation to secure democracy around the world  to monitor and oversee free and fair elections in other countries  most recently in Iraq  then we must ensure  protect and guarantee the right to vote right here at home         The Count Every Vote Act of 2005 will provide a voter verified paper ballot for every vote cast in electronic voting machines and ensures access to voter verification for all citizens  including language minority voters  illiterate voters and voters with disabilities  The bill mandates that this ballot be the official ballot for purposes of a recount  The bill sets a uniform standard for provisional ballots so that every qualified voter will know their votes are treated equally  and requires the Federal Election Assistance Commission to issue standards that ensure uniform access to voting machines and trained election personnel in every community  The bill also improves security measures for electronic voting machines         To encourage more citizens to exercise their right to vote  the Count Every Vote Act designates Election Day a federal holiday and requires early voting in each state  The bill also enacts  no excuse  absentee balloting  enacts fair and uniform voter registration and identification  and requires states to allow citizens to register to vote on Election Day  It also requires the Election Assistance Commission to work with states to reduce wait times for voters at polling places  In addition  the legislation restores voting rights for felons who have repaid their debt to society         The Count Every Vote Act also includes measures to protect voters from deceptive practices and conflicts of interest that harm voter trust in the integrity of the system  In particular  the bill restricts the ability of chief state election officials as well as owners and senior managers of voting machine manufacturers to engage in certain kinds of political activity  The bill also makes it a federal crime to commit deceptive practices  such as sending flyers into minority neighborhoods telling voters the wrong voting date  and makes these practices a felony punishable by up to a year of imprisonment        Today  representatives from civil rights organizations and voting rights advocates praised the legislation  including People For the American Way  Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under the Law  NAACP  Common Cause  the National Voting Rights Institute  DEMOS and the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium  The leaders emphasized the urgent need for the bill          Every American citizen should be able to cast a vote that counts  and it should not be difficult   said Ralph G  Neas  President of People For the American Way  one of the founding members of the Election Protection coalition   This bill provides practical  secure accessible solutions at the ballot box for Americans with disabilities  those who speak languages other than English  and other Americans who face hurdles in exercising their voting rights  It s a great bill           The Count Every Vote Act will go a long way toward restoring dignity to our nation s electoral system and will provide citizens across the nation with an opportunity to effectively participate in democratic decision making   said Barbara R  Arnwine  Executive Director of the Lawyers  Committee        Senators Clinton and Boxer first introduced election reform legislation in the 108th Congress  together with former Senator Bob Graham  In the meantime  another election cycle showed evidence of problems in the Federal election system  including long wait times to vote  erroneous purging of voters  voter suppression and intimidation and unequal access to the voting process  The Count Every Vote Act requires that all provisions be in place for the next major election cycle in 2006          We cannot let another Election Day go by without doing everything we can to make sure that voters have confidence in our voting system and exercise their right to vote   underscored Senator Clinton   This shouldn t be a Republican or Democratic issue  This is a voter issue  plain and simple  I call upon my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work with us to implement these common sense measures         Senators Clinton and Boxer and Representative Tubbs Jones will work in the 109th Congress to keep attention to this issue and urge action
