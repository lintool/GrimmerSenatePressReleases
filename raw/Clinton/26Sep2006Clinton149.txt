                  Schumer  Clinton  Defense Projects are Vitally Important for the New York Economy and National Security                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC   U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the Department of Defense Appropriations bill conference report filed late yesterday included  25 1 million for military projects in Western New York  The House and Senate must approve the bill before being sent to the President and signed into law            This is great news for Western New York   said Schumer   Additional funds will not only boost the area economy  but also put Western New York and New York State at the forefront of defense technology  As the men and women of our military bravely serve our country all over the world  the funding for these Western New York defense projects will vastly improve national security technology and will give our armed forces an even greater edge             This is wonderful news for Western New York  This is cutting edge defense technology being made locally  supporting our men and women in uniform and our national security  These are important investments in local companies and research institutions that will in turn help the economy as well  I look forward to their final approval by the Senate     Senator Clinton said          Funding in the FY 2007 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill includes          CUBRC    Lens X Hypervelocity Ground Testing    1 6 million    CUBRC has designed and tested a prototype of a revolutionary ground test facility capable of performing ground testing of full scale missile and space systems at Mach numbers from 10 to 22  These funds will fully complete  instrument and test this facility prior to the demonstration of its performance in investigating the communication  guidance and aero heating problems associated with advanced missile and space systems to mitigate the risks and costs associated with the new hypervelocity missile systems in initial development by the DOD  CUBRC is a strategic partnership whose mission is to bring together scientists and engineers from academia and industry to provide the synergism to expand the research capabilities of all and provide significant growth opportunities in Western New York        Carwell Products    Army and USMC Corrosion Prevention and Control Program    3 6 million    This funding will be used to expand the Department of Defense  s highly successful Corrosion Prevention and Control  CPC  Program and make it more responsive to current and future operations  This program focuses on extending the useful life of all Army and Marine Corps tactical ground and ground support equipment by reducing maintenance requirements and associated costs due to corrosion damage  The authorized funding would also create more highly effective mobile corrosion service teams  CST   Both the Army and The Marine Corps are currently using these CSTs with great effect  The mobile teams are most useful when used in lower density troop areas and where the use of fixed Corrosion Control Centers is not practical or cost effective  This effort is being expanded to include ports  depots and Army Propositioned Stock locations as well        NanoDynamics  Inc    Portable SOFC JP 8 Demonstrator    2 million    The Army has identified a critical need for lightweight man portable power  chargers  and power management for dismounted soldiers  In order to simplify logistics  the Army has selected JP 8 as the single fuel for future use  All vehicles and fuel consuming systems such as generators will be fueled by JP 8 in the future  Work has already begun work to scale up a small compact portable solid oxide fuel cell system to develop a technology demonstration system that produces 250 Watts of power utilizing JP 8 fuel  Past research has focused on the development of cells that were electrochemically efficient when operating on reformed JP 8 fuel and has been successful in developing a cell that has demonstrated no power loss when operating on JP 8 reformate  NanoDynamics will take the package and integrate them with the pumps  fans  fuel system  and control electronics necessary to produce a portable 50 Watt system  The system development work will based upon the existing NanoDynamics RevolutionTM 50 portable fuel cell system that was developed for commercial applications        Northrop Grumman Amherst   Joint Threat Emitter     14 million     The Joint Threat Emitter  JTE  system simulates electronic combat signals and is designed to provide realistic electronic warfare training for pilots and aircrew members  JTE has the capability to generate six modern threats from one platform and replaces aging  more expensive  single threat per platform units  which are more costly to support and do not have the flexibility to generate modern combat environments  The JTE capabilities  including the highly lethal   double digit   threats  add an essential element to combat training ranges  The system is specifically designed to allow spiral upgrades to ensure future threats are quickly integrated into its design  This funding will assist the Department of Defense in purchasing additional JTEs for three programs  Joint Threat Emitter for PTA  Joint Threat Emitter Mountain Home AFB  and Joint Threat Emitter for the US Air Force        DRS Electronic Warfare and Network Systems  DRS EWNS     UMTE Modernization    2 6 million    Federal funds will go to DRS    Electronic Warfare and Network Systems for the UMTE Modernization project  Money for the UMTE program will be used to upgrade four existing systems located at one of the key ranges at the Nellis Test and Training Range in Nevada  The continuing proliferation of surface to air missiles and other anti aircraft presents a significant threat to our military forces  This upgrade of the UMTE systems takes advantage of mature and electronic warfare threat simulation technology and will result in more realistic training  and increased aircrew survivability  while providing substantial savings  DRS received  8 million of federal funding for UMTE modernization in FY 06        DRS Electronic Warfare and Network Systems  DRS EWNS     Multi spectral Threat Emitter Systems    1 3 million    Federal funds will go to DRS Electronic Warfare and Network Systems  DRS EWNS  Multi spectral Threat Emitter Systems  The mobile MTES  s will support a number of East Coast electronic warfare training ranges for stand alone and joint force exercises  The multi spectral aspects of MTES have the ability to stimulate multiple aircraft sensors with one EW threat simulator on the ground  A MTES yields a higher return on investment for the Government and it meets joint force guidelines for training characteristics   DRS received  2 1 million of federal funding for MTES in FY06
