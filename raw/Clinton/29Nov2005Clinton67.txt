November 29  2005 Letter to Constituents on Iraq Policy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Dear Friend       The war in Iraq is on the minds of many of you who have written or who have called my office asking questions and expressing frustration  When the President addresses the nation tomorrow on the war  the American people want and deserve to know how we got there  why we are still there  how we have executed the war and what we should do now  In short  the President must explain his plan for the war in Iraq          There are no quick and easy solutions to the long and drawn out conflict this Administration triggered that consumes a billion dollars a week  involves 150 000 American troops  and has cost thousands of American lives          I do not believe that we should allow this to be an open ended commitment without limits or end  Nor do I believe that we can or should pull out of Iraq immediately  I believe we are at a critical point with the December 15th elections that should  if successful  allow us to start bringing home our troops in the coming year  while leaving behind a smaller contingent in safer areas with greater intelligence and quick strike capabilities  This will advance our interests  help fight terrorism and protect the interests of the Iraqi people          In October 2002  I voted for the resolution to authorize the Administration to use force in Iraq  I voted for it on the basis of the evidence presented by the Administration  assurances they gave that they would first seek to resolve the issue of weapons of mass destruction peacefully through United Nations sponsored inspections  and the argument that the resolution was needed because Saddam Hussein never did anything to comply with his obligations that he was not forced to do          Their assurances turned out to be empty ones  as the Administration refused repeated requests from the U N  inspectors to finish their work  And the  evidence  of weapons of mass destruction and links to al Qaeda turned out to be false          Based on the information that we have today  Congress never would have been asked to give the President authority to use force against Iraq  And if Congress had been asked  based on what we know now  we never would have agreed  given the lack of a long term plan  paltry international support  the proven absence of weapons of mass destruction  and the reallocation of troops and resources that might have been used in Afghanistan to eliminate Bin Laden and al Qaeda  and fully uproot the Taliban          Before I voted in 2002  the Administration publicly and privately assured me that they intended to use their authority to build international support in order to get the U N  weapons inspectors back into Iraq  as articulated by the President in his Cincinnati speech on October 7th  2002  As I said in my October 2002 floor statement  I took  the President at his word that he will try hard to pass a U N  resolution and will seek to avoid war  if at all possible           Instead  the Bush Administration short circuited the U N  inspectors   the last line of defense against the possibility that our intelligence was false  The Administration also abandoned securing a larger international coalition  alienating many of those who had joined us in Afghanistan          From the start of the war  I have been clear that I believed that the Administration did not have an adequate plan for what lay ahead          I take responsibility for my vote  and I  along with a majority of Americans  expect the President and his Administration to take responsibility for the false assurances  faulty evidence and mismanagement of the war          Given years of assurances that the war was nearly over and that the insurgents were in their  last throes   this Administration was either not being honest with the American people or did not know what was going on in Iraq          As a member of the Armed Services Committee  I heard General Eric Shinseki  the Army Chief of Staff  tell us that it would take several hundred thousand troops to stabilize Iraq  He was subsequently mocked and marginalized by the Bush Administration          In October 2003  I said  In the last year  however  I have been first perplexed  then surprised  then amazed  and even outraged and always frustrated by the implementation of the authority given the President by this Congress  and  Time and time again  the Administration has had the opportunity to level with the American people  Unfortunately  they haven t been willing to do that           I have continually raised doubts about the President s claims  lack of planning and execution of the war  while standing firmly in support of our troops          After my first trip to Iraq in November 2003  I returned troubled by the policies of the Administration and faulted the President for failing to level with the American public  At the Council on Foreign Relations  I chided the President for failing to bring in enough international partners to quell the insurgency       I spoke out often at the Armed Services Committee to Administration officials pointing out that the estimates they provided about the war  its length and cost lacked even basic credibility    And I challenged Secretary Rumsfeld more than once that he had no benchmarks to measure actual progress which would lead us to believe we had a strategy that was working    Last month  I signed a letter with Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid and dozens of other Democratic Senators voicing strong concerns that  without a solid plan  Iraq could become what it was not before the war  a haven for radical Islamist terrorists determined to attack America  our allies and our interests  The letter asked the Administration  to immediately provide a strategy for success in order to prevent this outcome     Just a few weeks ago  I joined a bipartisan majority in the United States Senate in voting for an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill calling upon the President and his Administration to provide answers and a plan for the war       It is time for the President to stop serving up platitudes and present us with a plan for finishing this war with success and honor    not a rigid timetable that terrorists can exploit  but a public plan for winning and concluding the war  And it is past time for the President  Vice President  or anyone else associated with them to stop impugning the patriotism of their critics          Criticism of this Administration s policies should not in any way be confused with softness against terrorists  inadequate support for democracy or lack of patriotism  I am grateful to the men and women of our armed forces and have been honored to meet them twice in Iraq  They honor our country every day with their courage  selfless dedication  and success in battle  I am also grateful to the thousands of unknown men and women in our security forces and around the world who have been fighting the larger war against terrorism  finding terrorists   cells  arresting them and working to prevent future attacks  And I applaud the brave people who have been risking their lives every day to bring democracy and peace to Afghanistan and Iraq          I recently returned from visiting Israel and Jordan  seeing first hand the tragedy of spreading terrorism  As a New York Senator  I believe New York has a special bond with the victims of such terrorism  and we understand both the need to fight terrorism and the need for a clear plan in Iraq so that we can focus our resources in the right ways to prevent it from again reaching our shores          America has a big job to do now  We must set reasonable goals to finish what we started and successfully turn over Iraqi security to Iraqis  We must deny terrorists the prize they are now seeking in Iraq  We must repair the damage done to our reputation  We must reform our intelligence system so we never go to war on false premises again  We must repair the breach with the Muslim world  And we must continue to fight terrorism wherever it exists          Like all Americans  I hope the Iraqi elections are a true expression of democracy  one that is committed to majority rule  minority rights  women s rights  and the basic rule of law  I hope these elections will finally put the Iraqi people on the road to real security and independence          If these elections succeed  we should be able to start drawing down our troops  but we should also plan to continue to help secure the country and the region with a smaller footprint on an as needed basis  I call on the President both for such a plan and for a full and honest accounting of the failures of intelligence    something we owe not only to those killed and wounded and their families  but to all Americans          We have to continue the fight against terrorism and make sure we apply America s best values and effective strategies in making our world and country a better and safer place  We have to do what is right and smart in the war against terrorists and pursuit of democracy and security  That means repudiating torture which undermines America s values  That means reforming intelligence and its use by decision makers  That means rejecting the Administration s doctrine of preemptive war and their preference to going it alone rather than building real international support          I know when America leads with its values and fearlessly faces the facts  we make the best decisions  That is what is missing at the highest levels of our government  and what we desperately need now    answers to the questions about Iraq that only the President can provide  I hope he will level with the American people and provide us those answers in his Annapolis speech and give us the plan that has been sorely lacking          Sincerely yours          Hillary Rodham Clinton        Click here for more of Senator Clinton s statements concerning the war in Iraq
