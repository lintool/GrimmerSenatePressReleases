October 4  2007 Bipartisan Group of Senators Introduce Bill to Require Report on Iraq Redeployment Planning from Administration                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC    In an effort to continue toward a new way forward in Iraq  United States Senators Ken Salazar  D CO   Lamar Alexander  R TN   Mark Pryor  D AR   Susan Collins  R ME   Hillary Clinton  D NY   George Voinovich  R OH   Elizabeth Dole  R NC   and Jim Webb  D VA  introduced a bill that would require a report on the status of redeployment planning from the Administration   The bipartisan bill requires the Department of Defense to provide its report within 60 days to congressional defense committees  with updated reports every 90 days thereafter    The bill is identical to bipartisan legislation authored by U S  Representatives John Tanner  D TN   Neil Abercrombie  D HI   and Phil English   R PA  that passed the House this week in a 377 to 46 vote    We must all work together to find a new way forward in Iraq and this bill is an important first step  said Senator Salazar   This is a substantive and bipartisan effort to work together to bring a responsible and timely redeployment of our troops   The men and women that are fighting this war in our name deserve no less     Both this bill and our Iraq Study Group legislation ask the administration for a plan on how to shift gears and get our troops out of the combat business and into the support  training  and equipping business  said Senator Alexander   Both bills also allow our government to speak with one voice going forward in Iraq  which our troops deserve and the enemy needs to hear    I have been asking the President for more than four years to develop a strategy to bring our troops home  Senator Pryor said   I am proud to be part of this bipartisan approach that finds common ground and moves Congress past partisanship and towards progress     The vitriolic partisan debate in Washington has not been conducive to finding a solution that will change the course in Iraq  said Senator Collins   I have long maintained that our country needs a new direction in Iraq that sets the stage for a significant but responsible drawdown of our combat troops and that encourages a lasting political solution to the sectarian violence engulfing Baghdad  I am pleased to join this bipartisan group of my colleagues on this legislation  and it is my hope that this bill will continue to gain bipartisan support    The roots of the many problems facing our men and women serving in Iraq were planted by the failure of this Administration to develop sound  realistic plans  We cannot afford to repeat the same mistake when our forces redeploy  said Senator Clinton   Redeploying out of Iraq will be difficult and requires careful planning   The Administration must provide a redeployment strategy that will keep our brave men and women safe as they leave Iraq    Conducting oversight of the government  the administration and the war is not only our responsibility  it is our duty  Senator Voinovich said  This bill allows us to fulfill that duty    I firmly believe that we must find common ground on a set of shared principles and work to bring our troops home as soon as possible  consistent with the security assessment of General Petraeus  said Senator Dole   This bipartisan measure is a positive step forward   The American people and the Iraqi government need to know that that our commitment in Iraq is not open ended   It is my hope that by next spring  units not withdrawn from Iraq could be reassigned to border security  training and support roles    Im pleased to support this renewed bipartisan call for the Department of Defense to meet its Constitutional requirement of conferring with Congress on the status of its redeployment planning  said Senator Webb    The bill would require the Secretary of Defense to provide a plan to Congress on troop missions and levels in Iraq  including a drawdown to a more limited mission that the Secretary would specify   The Senators said the bill ensures more Congressional oversight of our strategy in Iraq and it represents a bipartisan approach toward greater accountability over the Pentagons next steps     The legislation also    Should the Senate consider and pass this legislation without making further changes  it would proceed to the White House for the Presidents signature or veto      Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning the war in Iraq
