October 23  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Bush Administration s Request for Additional Iraq War Funding                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  With his announcement that his Administration will now seek nearly  200 billion in supplemental funding for overseas military operations  President Bush is once again asking Congress and the American people to foot the bill for his failed leadership   The Bush Administrations escalation in Iraq has not led to political reconciliation and our troops still remain in the middle of a civil war   As I have said before  I cannot and will not support funding legislation that does not begin to bring our troops home   Our men and women in uniform are serving bravely and honorably  funding a failing strategy does not serve our troops or our nation  We should begin the withdrawal of U S  troops safely and responsibly  Unless the Administration changes course in Iraq  I will vote against this supplemental request      Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning the war in Iraq
