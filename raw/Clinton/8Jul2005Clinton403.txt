                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC    Senator Clinton today sent a letter to Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff calling on him to release homeland security funding that Congress approved last year but that has not yet been sent to states   These critically needed funds would allow states to upgrade and strengthen rail and transit security and make other critical investments in homeland security   The letter was also signed by Senators Boxer  Carper  Corzine  Kennedy  Lautenberg  Lieberman  Reed and Schumer           We ask that you instruct the Department of Homeland Security to expedite dissemination of homeland security funding that will help secure our rail and transit systems     the Senators wrote in the letter     In the face of these imminent threats  and with over nine billion trips taken on public transportation each year  our citizens deserve existing and additional security resources to be distributed immediately             The Senators underscored the need to get states the funds they are already owed right away   At the same time  they emphasized the need to continue to invest in transit security          It is essential that the President and Congress allocate sufficient resources to this mission   In light of these recent attacks  we believe that more funding is needed specifically for rail and transit security resources than is provided for in the President  s FY 2006 Budget to be sure we are doing all we can to prevent against future terrorist attacks in this country     the Senators emphasized        The text of the letter follows          July 8  2005           The Honorable Michael Chertoff  Secretary  United States Department of Homeland Security  Washington  D C   20528          Dear Mr  Secretary           We write to you in the immediate wake of Thursday  s terrorist attacks in London   Initial reports indicate that dozens have been killed and hundreds more injured   We support the efforts of officials charged with responding to these attacks   These acts of terrorism only strengthen our resolve to ensure that the freedom our society enjoys shall endure             The attacks on the trains and buses in London remind us of the gruesome cowardly attacks against which we must defend ourselves   These recent attacks also remind us of the horrific acts of terrorism that Madrid suffered in March  2004  when nearly 200 people were killed and over one thousand were injured as a result of explosives planted on trains during their morning rush hour   The similarities of these attacks are an indication that terrorist groups continue to exploit vulnerabilities that exist in our public transportation systems   We simply cannot continue to ignore these weaknesses           As you know  the Department of Homeland Security is charged with preventing terrorist attacks within the United States and reducing our vulnerabilities to such attacks   It is essential that the President and Congress allocate sufficient resources to this mission   In light of these recent attacks  we believe that more funding is needed specifically for rail and transit security resources than is provided for in the President  s FY 2006 Budget to be sure we are doing all we can to prevent against future terrorist attacks in this country   Additionally  we urge you to ensure that funds already appropriated be made available without further delay           It is estimated that there is over  7 billion in security needs for our nation  s rail and transit systems and yet there has only been approximately  300 million allocated for such public transportation security needs since the September 11  2001  attacks   We cannot continue to merely hope that attacks such as those we witnessed in Spain and now London do not occur in our cities across the United States   We must act to ensure that our transportation systems have the resources they need immediately             According to the Senate Homeland Security Subcommittee on Appropriations  many of the homeland security grants that were appropriated by Congress in the fiscal year 2005 Homeland Security Appropriations bill have not been distributed for upgrading and improving port security  improving intercity bus security  hiring additional firefighters  and improving transit security   Further  funds for the Buffer Protection Plans were not released until just recently   We ask that you instruct the Department of Homeland Security to expedite dissemination of homeland security funding that will help secure our rail and transit systems   In the face of these imminent threats  and with over 9 billion trips taken on public transportation each year  our citizens deserve existing and additional security resources to be distributed immediately
