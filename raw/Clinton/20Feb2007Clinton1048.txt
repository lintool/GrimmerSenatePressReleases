February 20  2007 Senators Push for Highlands Funding                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Legislators Urge Support for Land Conservation Projects                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC   In a letter to Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne  U S  Senators Robert Menendez  D NJ   Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ   Christopher J  Dodd  D CT   Joe Lieberman  D CT   Charles E  Schumer  D NY   and Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  urged the inclusion of at least  2 million in funding for the Highlands Conservation Act for the remaining fiscal year  This landmark legislation authorizes  11 million per year over ten years for land conservation and technical assistant projects in New Jersey  New York  Connecticut and Pennsylvania  including  10 million per year for Land Conservation Partnership Projects funded through the Department of the Interior            The administration s 2007 fiscal year budget included  2 million for the Highlands  and the House and Senate Appropriations committees both included funding for the Highlands in their respective bills  However  the continuing resolution that covers federal government funding for the remainder of 2007 does not require the Interior Department to financially back the Highlands  Because of this  the senators are asking the department to follow the clear wishes of both the administration and Congress by funding the Highlands            From providing clean drinking water  to protecting animals  to supplying beautiful scenery  this land is a vital part of the health and wellbeing of our communities   Menendez said   It is imperative that the Highlands be funded at the levels agreed to by both the House and the Senate              The Highlands is one of New Jersey s most important natural regions   said Lautenberg   That is why the Bush Administration and Congress must work to provide the necessary funds for important land conservation projects so those in New Jersey who depend on the Highlands for drinking water  recreation and natural beauty aren t shortchanged             This funding will protect a tremendous natural treasure   said Dodd   The pristine Highlands provide millions of gallons of drinking water  a home to threatened or endangered species  and recreational areas for Americans to enjoy  so it is essential that we protect and conserve this habitat for the benefit of future generations             The Highlands forest is a magnificent natural habitat and valuable natural resource in Northwest Connecticut   Lieberman said   I join my colleagues in urging the Interior Department to provide the necessary funding to conserve this important open space  its wildlife  and the drinking water it supplies             This funding is crucial to protecting quality drinking water to more than 11 million people in the four state region  recreational land and open space in the Highlands providing habitat to many endangered species of plants and animals   Schumer said   With the pressure of sprawl constantly increasing and threatening our open spaces  we need to take steps to make sure that the clean air  water  and environment that New Yorkers enjoy today survive for future generations  This funding would mark a big step forward in that effort             It is vital that we continue to preserve our open space in the New York metropolitan region and the Lower Hudson Valley  This funding is not only necessary for the environmental health of the Highlands  it is also crucial in preserving essential natural resources that have a significant impact on the quality of life of residents  I strongly urge the Secretary to support this funding so that the Highlands of New York  as well as the surrounding states can have the protection that they need and deserve   Senator Clinton said         The full text of the Letter appears below       Dear Secretary Kempthorne            With the recent passage of the Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution for Fiscal Year 2007  H  J  Res  20   we are writing to request that you provide at least  2 million in funding for land conservation partnerships as authorized by the Highlands Conservation Act of 2004  P L  108 421   We greatly appreciate the past efforts of your department to meet pressing land conservation needs in the Highlands  including the leadership of Deputy Secretary Scarlett in the passage of the Highlands Conservation Act  and we hope that you will continue to support the Act in FY 2007                       The President s budget request for FY 2007 included  2 million for the Highlands Conservation Act to support conservation projects in the four Highland states of Pennsylvania  New Jersey  New York and Connecticut  This landmark legislation authorizes  11 million per year over 10 years for land conservation and technical assistance projects in this four state region  including  10 million per year for Land Conservation Partnership Projects funded through the Department of the Interior                     This funding could not come at a more critical time  Development pressures have caused more then 5 000 acres of forest and farmland to be lost annually to development in the New York New Jersey Highlands alone   The Governors of the four Highlands States have jointly submitted projects totaling  10 million in need to the Department of the Interior for funding in FY 2007  including the Wyanokie Highlands in New Jersey  Oley Hills in Pennsylvania  Litchfield Farms in Connecticut  and Great Swamp and Arrow Park in New York  These areas help provide drinking water supplies for millions of people and habitat for numerous bird and aquatic species  In addition  they protect incredible scenic vistas that are increasingly rare in our heavily developed region                        Funding for the Highlands in FY 2007 has the support of the President and both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees  We therefore respectfully urge you to include the full  2 million from the President s request for the Highlands Conservation Act for FY 2007                         Thank you for your consideration of this request         Sincerely
