May 23  2007 Clinton  Hagel  Menendez Introduce Measure to Remove Barriers to Reunification for Immigrant Families                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Washington  DC   Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   Chuck Hagel  R NE  and Robert Menendez  D NJ  today introduced an amendment to the Border Security and Immigration Reform Act of 2007 that would remove barriers to reunification for the nuclear families of lawful permanent residents   The amendment would reclassify the spouses and minor children of lawful permanent immigrants as  immediate relatives   thereby exempting them from the visa caps               The United States is a country built by immigrants  but our laws are tearing legal immigrant families apart   said Senator Clinton    Hundreds of thousands of lawful permanent residents have been waiting for years to be reunited with their spouses and children due to visa backlogs   These are taxpaying  law abiding residents   These are people who otherwise would be admitted into this country  but they are forced to wait because of a tragic numbers game   It is unconscionable that they are being forced to choose between their family and their newly adopted country            This amendment is about fundamental fairness   The families of legal permanent residents of this country who are playing by the rules should not be penalized because our current immigration system is paralyzed with backlogs   Senator Hagel said           Sen  Robert Menendez said   We are facing a fundamental change to the values of our immigration system  The bedrock principle of family would be drastically diminished under this deal   Passing this amendment would promote social stability and show that family values do not  in fact  end at the Rio Grande  as the president likes to say           Due to backlogs  the current waiting time for the spouse or minor children of a lawful permanent resident to obtain a green card is as much as five to ten years   During this waiting period  the spouse or child is not allowed to enter the United States  even for a brief visit   At the same time  the legal permanent resident is required to reside predominantly in the United States   otherwise he or she risks losing their permanent residency status            Legal permanent residents are the only immigrants subjected to these requirements   Under current law  United States citizens can bring their foreign born spouses and minor children into the country without any real wait   So too can students  temporary workers  and others   Only lawful permanent residents must wait years apart from their spouses and minor children             According to the State Department  currently hundreds of thousands of lawful permanent residents are waiting for their spouses  or children s green card petitions to be processed   The separation is not only inhumane and inconsistent with our nation s commitment to the value and importance of nuclear families  but it exacts an economic toll  as lawful immigrants who are productive members of society move out of the country to rejoin their families   Moreover  barriers to reunification with immediate family members create an undesirable incentive to break the law and live in the U S  illegally          The Clinton Hagel Menendez amendment is garnering widespread support           This amendment would establish that America is committed to the principle of keeping families together   By passing it we are saying that legal permanent residents should be able to reunite with their spouses and minor children without waiting in the huge backlogs which separate them under current law   This amendment is good for America s families  and good for the country as a whole   said Janet Murgia  President of National Council of La Raza           We applaud Senators Clinton  Hagel and Menendez for cosponsoring this very important amendment   The proposed bill does not address the five or more year backlog facing spouses and minor children of legal permanent residents nor does it provide a sufficient number of visas in the future   In order for the reform to achieve the goal of reducing the push to come illegally  we must reduce the time that spouses and minor children are separate from each other   said Karen K  Narasaki  President of the Asian American Justice Center           Senator Clinton has consistently provided leadership on this issue   She has never lost sight of the real families and children impacted by our broken immigration system   said Reverend Luis Cort    s  Founder and President of Esperanza  the largest Hispanic Evangelical organization    Senator Clinton s amendment would help reunite families now torn apart because of an unfair policy  and I want to thank her for her courage and commitment to fixing this injustice             Our concern is for the husbands  wives and children who in fact are immediate family members of people we have invited into this country as permanent residents  By lifting the cap on these close family members  the amendment that Senators Clinton  Hagel and Menendez have proposed will ensure that these families are not pointlessly separated   said Gideon Aronoff  President and CEO of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society  HIAS            The Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service applauds Senators Clinton  Hagel and Menendez for putting the principle of  families first  back into this legislation   This amendment makes it possible for thousands of spouses and young children who have been separated from their families for an average of nearly 5 years to reunite far more quickly   Bringing families together is a core American value that LIRS stands firmly behind   said Gregory Chen  Director for Legislative Affairs  the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service           Families are the building blocks of an ordered and procreative society through which people are able to grow and experience the love of God   Our government must promote laws and policies that strengthen the well being of all families  including immigrant families   It is through families that our communities are more stable and stronger and the Clinton Hagel amendment would allow those who have waited legally  the right way  to be more quickly reunited with their loved ones   World Relief commends Senator Clinton  Senator Hagel and Senator Menendez s commitment to the issue of family reunification within the Comprehensive Immigration Reform debate and looks to their leadership to continue to place priority on the value of family   said Dan Kosten  Director of the World Relief Refugee and Immigration Programs           The amendment to exempt the spouses and minor children of LPRs from visa caps resonates with the Latino community  which puts such a high premium on family reunification   The current backlog tears families apart unnecessarily and is contrary to our core American value of family unity   We support any and all efforts to keep our families together and protect the rights of legal  tax paying immigrants   said Eric M  Gutierrez  Legislative Staff Attorney  Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund  MALDEF            The amendment to be offered by Senators Clinton  Hagel and Menendez helps restore an element of family unity to the Senate compromise bill   As proposed  the legislation leaves family values at the Rio Grande   said Kevin Appleby  Director  Migration and Refugee Policy  U S  Conference of Catholic Bishops              The Border Security and Immigration Reform Act of 2007 would not raise the visa cap on the spouses and minor children of lawful permanent residents at all and even lowers it slightly   Unlike other family preference categories  the Act also does not allocate any additional visas to reducing the backlog for the spouses and minor children of lawful permanent residents   Thus  unless amended  the Act ensures that backlogs will continue if enacted
