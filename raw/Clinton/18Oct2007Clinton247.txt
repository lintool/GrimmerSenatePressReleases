                Washington  DC  Senators Clinton  Murray and Kennedy today led a coalition of Senators in sending a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt urging the Administration to withdraw its appointment of Dr  Susan Orr as Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Population Affairs   In this position  Dr  Orr  whose record directly contradicts her appointed duties  will oversee the Title X program which funds the only low cost family planning and health screening services for millions of low income and uninsured Americans   Senators Maria Cantwell  D WA   Tom Harkin  D IA   Bernard Sanders  I VT   Barbara Mikulski  D MD   John F  Kerry  D MA   Sheldon Whitehouse  D RI   Sherrod Brown  D OH   Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ   Patrick J  Leahy  D VT   Charles E  Schumer  D NY   Benjamin L  Cardin  D MD   Robert Menendez  D NJ   Barbara Boxer  D CA   Chris Dodd  D CT   Richard J  Durbin  D IL   and Claire McCaskill  D MO  joined in sending todays letter    The American people deserve a qualified public health expert who will ensure that the needs of women and families are met  In light of Dr  Orrs ideological record on Title X services  we urge you to withdraw her appointment and select an appointee who will actively implement Title X as intended by Congress under current law  the Senators wrote      Dr  Orr has been a vocal opponent of contraception equity  while often urging the Administration to put personal beliefs before facts  Prior to joining the Bush Administration  Dr  Orr was a director for an organization whose ideologically driven agenda opposed the scientifically based FDA approval of Plan B   In this position  Dr  Orr applauded a Bush proposal to halt requiring all health insurance plans for federal employees to cover an extensive range of birth control  Dr  Orr also encouraged President Bush to overrule scientists and doctors to revoke FDA approval for RU 486    Last November  the Senators joined eleven of their colleagues in opposing the nomination of another anti contraception advocate  Eric Keroack to the same position which lead to his resignation  The appointment of Dr  Orr continues the Bush Administration tradition of placing ideology before science  At the urging of the Administration  the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  repeatedly blocked the over the counter application of the emergency contraceptive Plan B despite the overwhelming support of the agency s own scientific advisory panel  The agency finally suggested approval only after a years long fight with Congress led by Senators Patty Murray  D WA  and Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY    The trumping of science by ideology is also illustrated with President Bush s veto of scientifically backed stem cell research     The following is the text of the letter to Secretary Leavitt    October 18  2007    The Honorable Michael Leavitt  Department of Health and Human Services  200 Independence Avenue  S W   Washington  DC 20201   Dear Secretary Leavitt    We write to express our deep concern over the appointment of Dr  Susan Orr to be Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Population Affairs      The office to which Dr  Orr has been appointed gives her the authority over Title X which funds low cost  confidential family planning and health screening services that would otherwise be out of reach for millions of Americans   Dr  Orr would also oversee counseling and providing information to women on a broad range of family planning and reproductive services  including contraception     Dr  Orr has a troubling history of opposing federal funding for contraception  which is counter to the mission of the office to which she has been appointed  In 2001  she spoke in favor of a Bush administration plan to drop a requirement that health insurance for federal employees must cover birth control  Were quite pleased because fertility is not a disease  she said at the time on contraception  Its not a medical necessity that you have it    Dr  Orr also publicly urged President Bush to overrule scientists and doctors to revoke FDA approval of RU 486  Before joining the Bush Administration  she had been a senior director of an organization that labeled the scientifically based  FDA approval of Plan B a grave threat to womens health    Unfortunately  this nomination is part of a disturbing Administration pattern of disregarding science and placing ideology ahead of sound decisions on womens health  In fact  last November  many of us opposed the nomination of Eric Keroack to the same position because of similar concerns      The American people deserve a qualified public health expert who will ensure that the needs of women and families are met  In light of Dr  Orrs ideological record on Title X services  we urge you to withdraw her appointment and select an appointee who will actively implement Title X as intended by Congress under current law    Sincerely    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   Senator Patty Murray  D WA    Senator Edward M  Kennedy  D MA   Maria Cantwell  D WA    Tom Harkin  D IA   Bernard Sanders  I VT   Barbara Mikulski  D MD   John F  Kerry  D MA   Sheldon Whitehouse  D RI   Sherrod Brown  D OH   Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ   Patrick J  Leahy  D VT   Charles E  Schumer  D NY   Benjamin L  Cardin  D MD   Robert Menendez  D NJ
