June 15  2005 Murray  Clinton Place  Hold  on Nomination of FDA Head                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Senators unsatisfied with lack of answers  continued delays  on approval of Plan B for over the counter use                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC    U S  Senators Patty Murray  Wash  and Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY   members of the Senate Health Education and Labor Committee  HELP   today voted against the nomination of Dr  Lester Crawford to head the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  and placed a hold on his nomination  delaying consideration by the full Senate        The Senators  hold will remain in effect until FDA issues a yes or no decision on the over the counter application of Plan B emergency contraceptives         We are asking FDA to explain why they are delaying an over the counter application for Plan B that even their own Advisory Panel overwhelmingly recommended for approval  We are not asking for a specific outcome  but for some final outcome   Senator Murray said   American consumers demand an independent FDA and American women deserve direct access to safe and effective treatments  I fear that the case of Plan B highlights a leadership problem at FDA    a leadership that can be biased or open to undue influence           Our request is simple and straightforward  We want the FDA to make a decision    yes or no  After almost two years of waiting  the American people have the right to an answer   said Senator Clinton   At a time when the FDA needs a strong leader to restore its reputation  I fear that Dr  Crawford s record demonstrates a lack of vision and drive to ensure that the FDA upholds its gold standard of drug regulation  He has failed to address the concerns raised by his own employees about the needs of the agency  And he cannot provide assurances that the FDA will make science  not ideology or other interests  the cornerstone of its decision making         At a HELP Committee hearing in March  the Senators pressed Crawford to answer questions about a long pending application for nationwide over the counter approval of Plan B contraceptives  The FDA Advisory Committee overwhelmingly recommended over the counter approval in December of 2003  but a decision has still not been made        Unsatisfied with Crawford s lack of answers  Murray asserted the need for a specific briefing on the status of Plan B prior to a vote on Crawford s nomination  Crawford briefed Senators Murray  Clinton and Ted Kennedy  D MA  on April 6th  but failed to provide an answer as to when a decision on Plan B could be expected  despite having already missed the Prescription Drug User Fee Act Deadline in January 2005        Two months have passed since the Senators met with Crawford and FDA has still not moved forward with a decision on Plan B         All we are asking for today is that FDA follows procedures set out in law for drug approval  American patients deserve access to safe and effective treatments in a timely manner   Murray said   We are placing a hold on Dr  Crawford because it is time to return credibility to FDA          The law that governs the timing of FDA decisions    the Prescription Drug User Fee Act  PDFA     demands that the FDA make decisions on applications within ten months of the original application s submission and within six months of an amended application  In the case of Plan B  the deadline was January 21  2005  It has been almost five months since that date  PDFUA has clearly been violated   Clinton said   I am calling upon the GAO today to expedite their review so that the Senate is able to have the best information at its disposal          Attached  please find a timeline of FDA s approval process for Plan B        TIMELINE        FDA Approval Process for Plan B Emergency Contraceptive       July 1999       The FDA approved  on label  use of Plan B as an emergency contraceptive available by prescription        April 2003       The manufacturer submitted an application to the FDA

on the confirmation of FDA Nominee Lester Crawford  Senators Murray and Clinton pressed Crawford to explain the delays in approving Plan B for over the counter use  Crawford agreed to brief HELP
