May 24  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC    Tonight I voted against the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill because it fails to compel the President to give our troops a new strategy in Iraq  I believe that the President should begin a phased redeployment of our troops out of Iraq and abandon this escalation   I fully support our troops  and wish the President had followed the will of the people and signed the original bill we sent which both funded the troops and set a new course of phased redeployment   But the President vetoed Congress s new strategy and so Congress must reject the President s failed policies  I will also continue to press with Senator Byrd for our legislation to end the authorization of the war in Iraq          While I am deeply disappointed that the supplemental does not provide for a new course in Iraq  I want to recognize the many worthy parts of this bill  funding to help those sickened in the aftermath of 9 11  additional relief for Katrina and Rita victims  homeland security funds for high threat cities like New York City  resources to protect parts of New York affected by recent flooding   650 million for the State Children s Health Insurance Program  and the first federal minimum wage increase in ten years  I support these measures but cannot support this Emergency Supplemental which will not change our course in Iraq
