June 8  2006 Senators Roberts and Clinton Discuss Pandemic Flu Preparedness on Senate Floor                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senators Pat Roberts  R KS  and Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  today delivered a colloquy on the floor of the U S  Senate regarding the need to pass critical legislation they introduced last October to help prevent recurring shortages of seasonal flu vaccine and strengthen our vaccine delivery infrastructure in the event of a pandemic flu outbreak         Click here to view video of the colloquy       The following are excerpts from the colloquy       Senator Roberts    You will see behind me a picture of a crowded emergency hospital at Fort Riley  Kansas during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic  The Spanish Flu eventually took the lives of more than 600 000 Americans and 50 million people worldwide  However  my colleagues may not be aware that the first human cases of the Spanish Flu in the U S  were discovered in my home state of Kansas at Camp Funston  Fort Riley             On the morning of March 11  1918  a company cook reported to the camp infirmary complaining of a bad cold  By noon  over 100 sick soldiers suffering the same bad cold also reported to the infirmary  These complaints of   bad colds    turned out to be the first cases of Spanish Flu in America  Within weeks  the Spanish influenza had spread to places far away as Camps Hancock  Lewis  and Sherman and even to several hundred prisoners at San Quentin  By the summer  the flu had reached around the globe  killing tens of thousands of people  This flu was so severe that attack plans during World War I had to be altered or postponed because there were shortages of healthy men to battle                     Senator Clinton    Senator Roberts has outlined the impact that the 1918 flu outbreak had  I would like to tell a different story    a story of a public health success  In March of 1947  New York faced an outbreak of smallpox  On April 4  the city began a mass vaccination campaign to prevent further cases  Over the next month  more than six million people were inoculated against smallpox    the largest mass vaccination campaign in U S  history  Through the cooperative efforts of local government employees  public health workers  and an army of volunteers  an outbreak was averted            Half a century later  we face a similar public health issue with the potential for a pandemic influenza  But if recent history is any indication  we will be unable to muster a response similar to the one we achieved in 1947  What is particularly worrisome to me  when thinking about our nation  s ability to face the threat posed by pandemic or avian influenza  is the fact that we aren  t even prepared to deal with the seasonal influenza epidemic that we face    that we know with certainty that we will face    every single year          Senator Roberts    As Senator Clinton has just highlighted  the need to be prepared for both seasonal flu and a potential avian flu pandemic is critical  Some believe the potential avian flu outbreak could be as lethal as the 1918 Spanish Flu  Human cases of avian flu have already been discovered in 10 countries  Three years ago  there were only 3 confirmed cases of avian flu in humans  Today  these numbers have grown to over 224 human cases and 127 deaths            As Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a member of the Senate Agriculture and Health  Education  Labor and Pension Committees  I take this threat of flu pandemic very seriously and view it not only as a public health concern  but also a national security concern  In February  I participated in an avian flu exercise at the National Defense University called Global Tempest  The exercise simulated a worst case scenario flu pandemic                      The exercise showed us firsthand how quickly our public health system and critical infrastructure services can be overwhelmed  how communication can easily break down and how panic can take hold amongst the public  We were forced with the difficult decisions of having to determine where limited medical supplies and personnel should be targeted  how the federal government can sustain the private sector and mitigate economic effects of the pandemic  and if and when the Department of Defense should be called in to assist with civilian efforts             This exercise taught us a valuable lesson  we must be prepared at all levels to deal with a large scale public health emergency such as pandemic flu  This system must be able to respond in any type of crisis  but more importantly  this system must be ready to respond before the crisis begins             Just last week  I hosted a pandemic flu planning conference in Kansas with Senator Brownback and Governor Sebelius  The conference included other federal  state and local officials  the business community  universities  health providers and hospitals  school administrators and many other stakeholders who came together to make sure Kansas is prepared in the event of an influenza pandemic            At the federal level  Senator Clinton and I took the lead last October and introduced legislation to help strengthen our nation  s flu vaccine system  The Influenza Vaccine Security Act takes a comprehensive approach and includes several provisions to improve our vaccine market and delivery system for the seasonal flu  but it also provides the framework that is absolutely critical during a pandemic flu             Senator Clinton    It is more critical than ever to ensure that our basic seasonal flu vaccine production and distribution system is capable of delivering vaccines to all who need them  especially with the threat of an avian flu pandemic looming over us  We must have a system in place that could handle rapid vaccine production  mobilization and delivery                        Many providers have contacted us to express frustration at their continuing inability to accurately predict at which point they may be able to provide needed supplies of influenza vaccine to their patients  At a time when we routinely use tracking to trace deliveries of other goods in the private market  we still cannot accurately predict when a vaccine order placed in the summer might actually be delivered to a provider in the winter  Our legislation establishes a tracking system through which we could better trace the distribution of vaccine from the factory to the provider and identify counties with high numbers of priority populations  With such a system in place  we could easily determine in times of shortage where vaccine was most needed and facilitate distribution to those areas  All of this could take place in a matter of hours  rather than days or weeks             Senator Roberts    Senator Clinton and I also recognize the critical need for domestic based vaccine manufacturers and increased production capacity in the event of a flu vaccine shortage or public health emergency that would require a mass need for vaccines or other countermeasures  This is why our bill improves the ability of the current manufacturers to remain in the U S  market and encourages more companies to enter the market with domestic based production facilities  We provide grants to manufacturers for technical assistance from the Food and Drug Administration and grants for capital improvements in technology or production capacity                 Our bill also addresses the need to quickly find medical professionals in the event of an emergency  We require the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to work with state and local health departments to develop a registry of medical personnel who can provide services during a public health emergency  Such a system was required under the Bioterrorism Act passed by Congress four years ago  but there is still no working system in place  This is unacceptable                        We must have a system that can easily identify doctors and other health professionals who can assist during a public health emergency  especially during an emergency that affects many areas across state lines  This will allow federal  state and local officials to move quickly and efficiently to provide immediate care to those in need        Senator Clinton    Our legislation would also provide funding for research into new vaccine based technology  such as cell based technology  We rely on production methods that haven  t kept pace with our other biomedical advances  In order to make a vaccine  strains of influenza virus are cultivated in chicken eggs  a non sterile environment  Many of the contamination problems we have seen with vaccine result when problems arise in this cultivation process  Although we  ve got to rely on this technology for the time being  we need to increase research into safer  faster  and more reliable methods of vaccine production              Senator Roberts    Over the last several months  Senator Clinton and I have worked with our colleagues on the HELP Committee to include the provisions from our bill we discussed today in the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act Reauthorization or the Bioshield II bill to be considered by the committee and full Senate  We are thankful for all of the attention and focus on planning for a pandemic flu  but we also believe that a few more steps need to be taken to make sure we are ready  This is why we are urging our colleagues to consider our legislation  the Influenza Vaccine Security Act  I finally want to thank Senator Clinton for all of her hard work and dedication to this issue
