April 6  2005 Schumer Clinton Amendment Forcing Deadbeat Diplomats To Pay Parking Tickets And Property Taxes Clears Major Hurdle In Senate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Amendment specifies that payment for tickets and taxes will now be transferred from foreign aid packages to NYC                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Today  the Senate unanimously backed an amendment from Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton to the State Department Authorization bill that would help the City of New York recoup millions of dollars from costs associated with unpaid diplomatic parking tickets and property taxes  Despite significant progress over the last year to collect parking tickets from deadbeat diplomats and to crack down on diplomatic building owners who owe property taxes  New York City is still owed millions from foreign consulates and embassies  This amendment would withhold foreign aid money from countries that owe outstanding debts to New York City and transfer the withheld funds directly to the city  This amendment would help to put a stop to the extraordinary delays that the city is facing in receiving the money it is owed        The Schumer Clinton amendment will reduce a county s foreign aid package by the amount that the country owes in unpaid New York City parking tickets and back property taxes  plus an additional ten percent penalty for a total of 110 percent  The provision would help NYC recover up to approximately  195 million repayment from up about 200 countries  The amendment would also apply to unpaid debts owed to Washington  D C         Few things are as crushing as getting one of those little orange envelopes from a traffic cop  If you or I ignore a parking ticket  we have to pay double the fine  If a diplomat ignores a parking ticket  we send him foreign aid  That makes no sense  And forget about not paying your property tax bill    they  ll take your house  Well  regardless of who you are or where you are from  you re not above the law in New York   Senator Schumer said         New York City residents  commuters and visitors are faced with tremendous burdens related to parking  It is simply outrageous for diplomats to park illegally and blatantly ignore paying their parking tickets   New Yorkers have to face severe financial penalties if they do this and so should diplomats   Senator Clinton said          Mayor Michael R  Bloomberg said   I am very pleased today that the Senate adopted the amendment proposed by Senators Schumer and Clinton to ensure that the countries that owe the City for parking tickets and real estate taxes pay their bills  I want to thank Senators Schumer and Clinton  who proposed the amendment for the City  and also Senators Lugar and Biden  who recognized the fairness of the City s position         Both the original parking fines and the interest levied by New York City will be charged  and all parking violations issued to diplomats between April 1997 and September 2005 will be counted against the foreign aid package
