                 Washington  DC   U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the Department of Defense Appropriations bill conference report filed late yesterday included approved  4 17 million for military projects in New York City   The House and Senate must approve the bill before being sent to the President and signed into law            This is great news for New York City   said Schumer   Additional funds will not only boost the area economy  but also put New York City and New York State at the forefront of defense technology  As the men and women of our military bravely serve our country all over the world  the funding for these New York City defense projects will vastly improve national security technology and will give our armed forces an even greater edge             This is wonderful news for New York City  This is cutting edge defense technology being made locally  supporting our men and women in uniform and our national security  These are important investments in local companies and research institutions that will in turn help the economy as well  I look forward to their final approval by the Senate     Senator Clinton said          Funding in the FY 2007 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill includes          New York University School of Medicine    Consortium on Preparedness    1 Million    The Consortium on Preparedness will involve a number of facilities including the NYU School of Medicine  the NYU Hospitals Center  the New York City  NYC  Health and Hospitals Corporation  Bellevue Hospital  and the Veterans Affairs  VA  New York Harbor Health System  New York campus  The goal of the Consortium on Preparedness will be to plan for large surges in patient populations  education and train medical and health personnel for possible events  provide psycho social support  and conduct research in the areas of bioterrorism and preparedness  Funding will be needed for support staff  equipment  information and telecommunication investments  as well as emergency preparedness and security needs       New York Structural Biology Center  NYSBC     1 17 Million    The NYSBC is a leading center in magnetic resonance spectroscopy  equipped with the most advanced grouping of spectrometers in the nation  Through collaborative efforts  NYSBC researchers and their counterparts at the Edgewood Chemical Biological Center  ECBC  are able to take advantage of the superior instrumentation and expertise at NYSBC to validate protocols that monitor the fate of chemical and biological warfare agents in battlefield and civilian environments such as concrete  asphalt  soil and water       Columbia University Medical Center  Mailman School of Public Health   Center for Catastrophe Preparedness and Response    1 Million    In 2003  the Mailman School of Public Health of Columbia University and the New York State Department of Health Wadsworth Center led a consortium of twenty eight institutions in New York  New Jersey and Connecticut in establishing the Northeast Biodefense Center  NBC   one of eight NIH regional centers of excellence in biodefense and emerging infectious diseases  The Columbia facility is the New York City base of the NBC  It also supports biodefense activities for the Departments of Health of New York City and New York State  as well as the World Health Organization Laboratory Network by providing surge capacity and access to unique diagnostic and pathogen surveillance technologies  Funds will be used to purchase equipment and to expand laboratory facilities for these new civil support functions as well as completing a new BSL 3 animal facility for research into vaccines and therapeutics for biodefense and emerging infectious diseases       Weidlinger Associates  Inc    Air Gun Shock Testing of Naval Vessels    1 Million    Funding will assist Weidlinger in developing new technology air gun ship shock testing equipment and procedures  This alternative shock test method will ensure continuance of meaningful shock testing that is environmentally acceptable  The air gun technology provides a method whereby shock testing with explosives can be replaced with non explosive sources based on the very rapid release of high pressure air reservoirs very close to the vessel under test  The resulting acoustic pulse provides excitation of the ship or barge which is directly analogous to the response and hence damage induced by an explosive warhead
