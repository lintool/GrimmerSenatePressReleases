November 18  2005 Clinton  Dewine  Obama  Smith Introduce Legislation To Help Property Owners Safeguard Against Lead Hazards In The Home                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  DC  Today  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   Mike DeWine  R OH   Barack Obama  D IL  and Gordon Smith  R OR  introduced legislation providing a tax credit for safely removing lead based paint hazards from homes and rental units   This bipartisan bill would provide needed incentives for property owners to ensure that homes are free of environmental hazards that can harm children          This bill will help to achieve the federal government  s established goal of eliminating toxic blood levels in young children by 2010   Exposure in the home is the number one source of lead for young children   By providing financial incentives to remove lead hazards from the home  exposure will be minimized and this disease  which is known to have incredibly harmful effects on child development  behavior and intelligence  can be prevented   We need to continue to work to end childhood lead poisoning and to ensure safe and healthy environments for our children     said Senator Clinton          As parents  we try to protect our kids as much as possible when they walk out the front door  when they  re on the roads  or when they  re on the playground with friends   But one of the biggest health risks to our kids can occur inside the home     said Senator DeWine     Dangerous lead paint exposures are entirely preventable   It just makes sense that we encourage parents to remove this hazard and protect our children             As both a father of two young daughters and a lawmaker  it pains me to think that each year nearly 28 000 children needlessly suffer from lead paint poisoning     said Obama   We need to take immediate action to protect our children by ensuring that dangerous lead paint is cleaned up properly             Lead poisoning is all the more tragic because it is preventable     Smith said     The homes where lead paint is most common are often the ones with families who lack the resources to remove it   It will take years to entirely remove this hazard  but we can get it done more quickly with a boost in financial support           This bill would change the IRS code of 1986 to provide a tax credit for 50  of the allowable costs paid by the taxpayer  up to a maximum of  3000 for lead abatement and  1000 for interim control measures  which could include window replacement  safe repainting and specialized renovation work practices to reduce lead hazards   These are cost effective means of protecting the largest number of children in the near term   The credit is targeted to homes with children younger than six years of age  women of childbearing age  low income residents  and buildings built before 1960  as these include more than 96  of all units where lead based paint is prevalent         Lead is highly toxic and continues to be a major preventable environmental health threat especially to infants  children  and pregnant women in the United States   Lead poisoning can be deadly  and almost one million children nationwide have toxic lead levels in their blood  that can impair their growth and the function of vital organs and motor skills   The most common source of lead exposure for children today is lead paint in older housing and the contaminated lead dust it generates   Despite a ban on lead paint in 1978  there are still millions of housing units in the United States that contain lead paint  especially in older homes           In New York State  about five percent of children screened for lead poisoning at age two were found to have elevated blood lead levels  more than twice the national average   New York counties where kids are especially at risk include  Onondaga  Fulton  Monroe  Erie  and Oneida   Approximately 10 000 cases of childhood lead poisoning in New York are found each year   Minority and poor children are disproportionately at risk   For example  in New York City  about 95  of children with elevated blood levels were African American  Hispanic or Asian        Illinois has the highest lead poisoning rate in the nation  According to an Illinois Department of Public Health report  Illinois amounted to 20 5 percent of all elevated blood levels reported nationwide  The report also found that African American children are more than three times as likely to suffer from elevated lead levels and Hispanic children are more than twice as likely to suffer from elevated lead levels        Senator Clinton and her colleagues have a strong record of advocacy on environmental health issues  Earlier this year  Senators Clinton and DeWine introduced the Family Asthma Act  which seeks to increase research into the links between environmental pollutants and the growing epidemic of asthma  And yesterday  Senators Obama and Clinton introduced the Healthy Communities Act  which would establish Health Action Zones to address environmental health concerns in our nation s most affected communities  Senator Clinton has also introduced the bipartisan Coordinated Environmental Health Network Act to strengthen the environmental health tracking program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
