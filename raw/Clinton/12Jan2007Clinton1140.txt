January 12  2007 Bishop  Schumer  Clinton Urge Restoration of Important Science Funding Affecting BNL                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             New Study Cites Dire Consequences if Funds are Not Restored                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC    Citing a new study from the Department of Energy  DOE   Congressman Tim Bishop and Senators Charles Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton warned today of dire consequences if funding is not restored to the DOE  s Office of Science   Among a number of impacts nationwide  the study warned that if funding is not increased  the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider  RHIC  at Brookhaven National Laboratory  BNL  will be shuttered for Fiscal Year 2007 and progress will stall on development of the National Synchrotron Light Source II  NSLS II           The funds are in peril because a FY 2007 budget has not been passed for the DOE  and as a result it is currently funded by a Continuing Resolution which funds the agency at the prior year  s levels   The proposed FY 2007 budgets that passed the House of Representatives and the Senate Appropriations Committee requested  4 1 billion for the Office of Science  a  505 million increase over FY 2006 funding   However  because the DOE  s funding for this year was going to remain flat  with the increase shifting to the Office of Science  Bishop  Schumer and Clinton are separately urging the DOE and House and Senate appropriators to allow the agency flexibility to fund important research            This unpredictable funding environment is devastating to our nation  s scientific competitiveness     Bishop said     Instead of being a world leader in scientific research  we are telling young scientists that if you want to do world class research in a stable environment  don  t do it here   We need to fix this situation and be able to assure the dedicated researchers at Brookhaven National Lab and other labs  that we will not have a repeat               Unless we stop starving Brookhaven of the funding it needs  we jeopardize ongoing scientific research that is vital to all Americans while risking the loss of high tech jobs that are essential to Long Island     said Senator Schumer said    To ensure that Brookhaven remains a regional powerhouse and that its research goes uninterrupted  we must restore this funding immediately                   We successfully worked to secure Brookhaven from the President  s budget cuts last year and now we are fighting again because the leadership of the last Congress abdicated their responsibility to complete these appropriations bills   We must have sufficient funding for what can only be described as a world class research facility     Senator Clinton said    We simply cannot continue to undermine our research facilities and our reputation in this way  We will do everything we can to get Brookhaven the funding it needs for the RHIC and NSLS II             The RHIC is a world renowned 2 4 mile superconductor that accelerates gold ions to nearly the speed of light and causes collisions that recreate the   Big Bang    offering a glimpse into the birth of the universe during its first few microseconds   For the upcoming fiscal year  its budget was scheduled to be increased by  40 8 million to  143 4 million  enabling full use of the billion dollar project          The NSLS II  an advanced scientific initiative  was scheduled to receive  45 million in new funding to begin design and development of a state of the art facility   The physical site of the NSLS II system has not been selected  however  the New York Congressional delegation has been working hard to site the facility at BNL   The funds for design and development for NSLS II would be administered by BNL
