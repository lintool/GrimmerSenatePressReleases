                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Senators Announce Money for Ashburton Avenue in Yonkers  Westchester Bee Line Buses  Short Clove Road in Haverstraw and Route 17 Widening Funded Through Transportation Authorization Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC     U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the Surface Transportation Reauthorization Bill  entitled the Safe  Accountable  Flexible  and Efficient Transportation Equity Act  A Legacy for Users  SAFETEA LU   was approved by the Conference Committee on which Senator Clinton served   The Conference Report includes an additional  35 5 million for Hudson Valley projects  out of over  230 million in special projects for New York  Senators Schumer and Clinton announced a substantial increase of approximately  3 billion in additional funding coming to New York State for highways and transit for a total of over  16 5 billion in total federal spending for New York          Specifically  the legislation includes  10 07 billion in highway funds and  6 5 billion for New York State  s transit systems  a 19 percent increase in annual average highway spending and a 30 percent increase in public transit funding compared to the previous six year transportation authorization bill   The bill also contains funding for research  safety  environment  transportation planning and security that will benefit all New Yorkers        Senator Clinton served as a member of the Conference between the House and Senate due to her role as a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee  Senator Schumer is a member of the Banking and Finance Committees  which control the transit funding and tax portions of the bill   Both Senators fought hard to ensure that provisions important to New York were retained in the Conference Report            This is great news for the Hudson Valley   These transportation funds keep New Yorkers moving quickly and safely  while creating jobs across the state  These federal dollars will be a huge shot in the arm for local transit needs    new buses  repairs for buses  and fixing up our stations    and highway repairs and upgrades   Without first rate highway and transit facilities  New York would literally stop short     Schumer said    Whether it s getting to work or getting groceries  Hudson Valley residents must get where they need to go quickly and efficiently  This funding will help the Westchester Bee Line and the Rockland County Express Buses to get their system s oldest buses off the road immediately and provide quality transportation for the millions who rely on these buses everyday   This funding will also make our roads safer  such as the intersection of Short Clove Road and Haverstraw  and less congested by eliminating traffic jams  such as those along Route 17 in Orange County           After two years of hard work  we have achieved a bill that will create jobs and bring significant resources to the Hudson Valley   These funds will go a long way towards helping communities make the infrastructure improvements needed to keep their economies moving     said Senator Clinton  who served as a Senate conferee in negotiations on the bill    I am proud that our efforts have resulted in New York s share of funds growing to meet the every increasing transportation demands on our state   We have made a substantial contribution to the future of the Hudson Valley region and Westchester County by investing in these critical road and transit projects   I am especially pleased that we were able to secure funding for the Westchester Bee Line and the Rockland County Express Buses  which will provide safe and improved public transportation for thousands of daily passengers   This funding is also going to improve the safety of the heavily trafficked intersection of US Route 9W and Short Clove Road in Haverstraw and bring economic growth and tourism to the Lower Hudson Valley by making necessary upgrades to Route 17  The dividends of these investments will pay off for years           The funding approved in the bill today includes          1 million that Senators Schumer and Clinton secured to widen Route 17 from four lanes to six lanes from Harriman to Monticello in order to accommodate millions of new  annual visitors to the area  These upgrades are absolutely vital to continuing economic growth in the region  easing traffic congestion  and ensuring that this roadway remains safe for motorists           9 million that Senators Schumer and Clinton secured for I 86 Route 17 Upgrades for Broome  Delaware  Chemung  Orange  Sullivan  and Cattaraugus Counties and  1 million for I 86 Route 17 Upgrades for Tioga County  The upgrade and designation of NYS Route 17 as Interstate 86 will make the Southern Tier  the Catskills  and the Lower Hudson Valley more competitive and able to attract substantial growth in business  industry  and tourism         6 million in funding that Schumer and Clinton secured to construct a bridge overpass over the intersection of US Route 9W and Short Clove Road in Haverstraw  NY  bringing total funding to  6 8 million in the bill   The overpass will improve safety and directly benefit planned and current redevelopment of the waterfront within the Village  aiding the expansion of Village and regional economy as traffic flow through the intersection is improved    The intersection is dangerous because it is also the site of an active freight rail right of way   With nearly sixty freight trains crossing the intersection daily  the trains frequently block emergency vehicles traveling throughout the region and regularly block traffic flow in US Route 9W   This interchange is also the primary road for access to the Hudson River Ferry  so it handles heavy commuter traffic          Additionally  Route 9W would be the principal evacuation route in case of emergency evacuation related to the Indian Point Nuclear Energy Center because The Village of Haverstraw is within the   Emergency Planning Zone    designated by the State of New York Emergency Management Office and Rockland County   When blocked  this intersection not only causes traffic jams  but could pose a serious safety threat to Rockland County           4 million that Schumer and Clinton secured in additional funding for the reconstruction of Ashburton Avenue in Yonkers bringing the total funding to approximately  5 2 million   This critical investment  which is required to connect major highways to downtown Yonkers  will widen Ashburton Avenue from Yonkers Avenue to Alexander Street in order to improve access to the rapidly growing waterfront area and support new residential development  This road  currently a two lane thoroughfare  is roughly one mile long   This is part of The City of Yonkers revitalization of this area  as part of its overall economic recovery strategy which has seen substantial progress in the last four years   In addition to other sites in the City  the Nepperhan Valley and Downtown Waterfront areas  which will directly benefit from this project  have been designated as a Federal Empowerment Zone and a New York State Empire Zone   Ashburton Avenue

funding that Senators Clinton and Schumer secured for the Westchester Bee Line to assist in the replacement of 114 over age buses in the County public transit fleet  30 of which are not ADA Accessible  The buses to be replaced have exceeded the 12 year recommended replacement age for heavy duty transit buses  but need to be kept in service in order to meet passenger demand   Westchester County would like to maintain its current replacement program  ordering replacement buses as the old ones pass the 12 year mark and accepting delivery of the replacements before they reach the 15th year   All new buses purchased by the County will use Ultra Low Sulfur fuel  and state of the art emissions treatment technology  and are currently beginning a demonstration project testing Hybrid Diesel Electric buses on its routes         3 million in additional funding that the Senators secured for the purchase of 55 replacement 45 foot over the road coaches of the Rockland County Express Buses  This is the major transit mode from Rockland County to the Manhattan Central Business District   The current fleet has coaches that have exceeded their useful life   These older coaches are not accessible to the handicapped community  a condition which will be remedied with the purchase of the requested replacement vehicles   Purchase of these buses would address ADA requirements  improve ambient air quality and potentially attract new riders with a modern fleet         1 million that Senators Schumer and Clinton secured for the restoration of the Van Cortlandt Manor Entrance near Croton in addition to funding provided by the House of Representatives for a total of approximately  3 million  The entrance to the historic Van Cortlandt Manor is seriously disfigured and threatens

the Medical Center with adjoining streets  and create parking spaces in a congested area         1 million that Senators Schumer and Clinton secured for streetscape and roadway improvements for the College of New Rochelle  The funds will be used to assist with transportation upgrades at the Interdisciplinary Center Dedicated to Wellness Education         1 million that Senators Schumer and Clinton secured for South Lexington and Post Road streetscape expansion in White Plains  These funds will be used to expand the City  s downtown streetscape improvements throughout the Central Business District including streetscape improvements  sidewalks  street crossings  trees  landscaping  and street furniture  This area of downtown has seen a great deal of recent investment from

between Route 300 and the 17K interchanges in the Meadowhill Area of Newburgh         1 million that Senators Schumer and Clinton secured for planning and interim improvements for the Manhattan  Bronx  Yonkers Hudson River Greenway Link  The funds would go towards planning and interim improvements along the four miles of Hudson River waterfront extending north from Inwood Hill Park on the northern tip of Manhattan  to the Riverdale and Yonkers Railroad Stations  and ending at the Beczak Environmental Center in Yonkers   The project would create a continuous recreational trail along the Hudson River that will connect the Bronx to the designated Hudson River Greenway Trail in Manhattan and the Westchester County RiverWalk        Senators Schumer and Clinton also secured Congressional authorization in the bill that will enable the MTA to pursue federal funds in future appropriations bills toward the future design and construction of a direct rail link to Stewart International Airport   The   New Start    designation allows the MTA and other project leaders to purse initial design and alternative analysis  kick starting the project and putting it line to receive significant

renaming all of I 86 after the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan  a fitting tribute to a man who once chaired the Environment and Public Works Committee and who fought hard in previous transportation reauthorization bills for the needs of New York   Senator Clinton introduced an Amendment last year that was accepted by the Senate during consideration of the surface transportation reauthorization bill   The provision was retained in this year  s bill and will now become law         9 25 million that Senators Schumer and Clinton secured for the University of Buffalo  s Multidisciplinary Center for Earthquake Engineering Research  MCEER   Clinton and Schumer secured approval for  1 25 million per year  over the next five years  in funding for research on the impact of seismic activity on the federal highway system and the nation  s transportation network as well as ways to reduce our vulnerability from earthquakes  In addition  the Senators provided an additional  3 million to support ongoing research activities   The funding will also help improve earthquake simulation facilities  This is an important economic generator in Western New York and will keep the University of Buffalo at the forefront of this important research  Senator Clinton promised to fight hard to include the Multidisciplinary Center for Earthquake Engineering Research  MCEER  in this version of the bill  MCEER is a national center of excellence in advanced technology applications dedicated to the reduction of earthquake losses nationwide  MCEER is headquartered at the

National Transportation System Study and the Commission on Future Revenue Sources to Support the Highway Trust Fund into one single commission  Senator Clinton worked with former NYSDOT Commissioner and current Federal Railroad Administrator Joe Boardman to push this idea forward   The objective of combining these two bodies into a comprehensive evaluation of the future of transportation and its financing provides a roadmap for better allocation of transportation funding resources in the future   A better allocation will mean funding based on needs  which can only help New York   It will hopefully result in rewards for New York because of high transit use  which contributes to a more sustainable transportation network        CargoWatch Technology    the Senators secured  3 5 million
