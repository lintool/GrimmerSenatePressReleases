August 16  2006 New Study Affirms Clinton and Reid Legislation Will Significantly Reduce Unwanted Pregnancies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  and Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid  D NV  today hailed the release of a new report from the non partisan Guttmacher Institute affirming that their legislation to expand access to contraception through Medicaid would reduce significantly the number of unintended pregnancies   The Guttmacher Institute Study    Rekindling Efforts to Prevent Unplanned Pregnancy  A Matter of Equity and Common Sense     found that legislation authored by Senators Clinton and Reid would enable low income women to prevent a total of nearly 500 000 unwanted pregnancies annually  including 200 000 abortions   By helping prevent an estimated 225 000 unwanted births  study found that the Clinton Reid approach would also save an estimated  1 5 billion in annual federal and state expenditures   The Clinton Reid bill  the Unintended Pregnancy Reduction Act of 2006  has been introduced in the U S  House of Representatives by Congresswoman Nita Lowey  D NY             This study makes clear that the way to reduce unintended pregnancies is to prevent them in the first place   Our common sense approach would have a significant impact and I hope these findings will build support for our legislation on both sides of the aisle     said Senator Clinton            Whether you are pro life or pro choice  there is no question that the rate of unintended pregnancy in America is unacceptably high     said Senator Reid     If we  re serious about breaking the stalemate in the abortion debate  both sides must stop posturing and start seeking the positive results we share   We have to work side by side to reduce the staggering rate of unintended pregnancies and the resulting abortions             The Clinton Reid bill will strengthen Medicaid coverage of family planning services by ensuring that Medicaid coverage for family planning services remains accessible to low income women  The bill will also amend the Medicaid statute to ensure that states extend coverage for family planning services and supplies to women who would be entitled to Medicaid funded prenatal  labor  delivery and postpartum care           The United States has one of the highest rates of unintended pregnancies in the industrialized world  Half of the six million pregnancies in America are unintended  and nearly half of those end in abortion every year  Many of these pregnancies can be prevented if we remove barriers preventing women from affordable contraception           Today  s report follows on the heels of a report released by the Guttmacher Institute in May revealing the tragic two tiered system that is steadily emerging in our country  High income women have quick  convenient access to contraceptives  while low income women do not and as a result more often become pregnant unintentionally  In fact  a poor woman is four times as likely to experience an unplanned pregnancy as a higher income woman           Senators Clinton and Reid have also introduced the Prevention First Act  a comprehensive bill aimed at reducing unintended pregnancies  preventing abortions and improving women s health  The bill would increase Title X  the nation s only program devoted solely to making family planning services available to all women  reduce teen pregnancy  provide equitable insurance coverage for contraception  and increase awareness about Emergency Contraception  The Prevention First Act would also save scarce public health dollars by  reducing the number of unintended pregnancies  reducing the rate of sexually transmitted disease  reducing the costs to the Medicaid program  and providing for the early detection of HIV  breast cancer and cervical cancer           Senator Clinton has also introduced a Congressional Resolution  introduced in the House by Representative Nita Lowey  in support of strengthening family planning services   The Clinton Lowey resolution calls on all members of Congress to put themselves on the record in support of family planning services and education  The resolution does not cost any money  it simply asks that Congress officially go on the record in support of programs and policies that make it easier for all women at all income levels to obtain contraceptives and use them consistently and correctly over time
