February 24  2006  Strong Bipartisan Push to Pass Emergency Legislation Suspending Dubai Port Deal Continues                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Schumer  Coleman  Menendez  Snowe  Clinton  Coburn  Collins  and Reed Will Push Legislation as Soon as Congress Resumes Session on Monday to Halt the Ports Deal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Washington  DC   Next week control of the Port of New York and New Jersey will be handed over to Dubai Ports World  a Dubai Company that is owned and operated by the United Arab Emirates  This  6 8 billion deal is scheduled to be closed on March 2  and was briskly approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS  last month   The approval allows the UAE  s government owned company to take control of significant operations at six U S  ports including  New York  New Jersey  Baltimore  New Orleans  Miami and Philadelphia  Except for cargo screening functions performed by the Department of Homeland Security  the Port operator is responsible for securing cargo coming in and out of the port  the port facility itself  and the hiring of security personnel            Today Senators Schumer  Norm Coleman  MN   Bob Menendez  NJ   Olympia Snowe  ME   Hillary Clinton  NY   Susan Collins  ME   Tom Coburn  OK   and Jack Reed  RI  announced emergency legislation to suspend the Dubai port deal immediately   Late last night  the companies announced a voluntary cooling off period  but that would not order a 45 day investigation  which is what the emergency bipartisan measure would require            Schumer stated    A brief period for the company to continue lobbying without the full 45 day investigation that should have been done from the beginning is simply not enough   If the President were to voluntarily institute the investigation and delay the contract that would be a good step   But a simple cooling off period will not allay our very serious concerns about this dubious deal               It is essential that Congress have the opportunity to exercise its oversight duties to ensure the safety and security of our ports  a vital component of our national security     said Coleman    For more than two years  I have worked on securing our nation  s ports  both at home and abroad    It is important to make sure all crucial components of our national security are in place and that is what our legislation is about   This bill gives Congress an additional 45 days to step back  gather more information  and submit a recommendation that is in the best interest of the country   I applaud Sen  Schumer  s leadership on this issue as we put in place the necessary oversight mechanisms regarding port sale transactions  I think all would agree that where national security is concerned  it is better that we take the time to appropriately assess what is at stake            Menendez said   Nothing in the announcement by Dubai Ports World changes the fact that unless the president or Congress acts  in less than a week operations at U S  ports will be in the hands of a foreign government   That is an unacceptable risk that we cannot tolerate             At this time of heightened terrorist threat  we can ill afford to add another element of risk to our nation  s homeland security    I believe it is absolutely essential that this deal does not proceed until the Congress has a greater understanding of any potential national security implications   That is why today I am pleased to join forces with my colleague from New York  Senator Schumer  in introducing legislation that would stop this takeover until a full 45 day investigation takes place   After all  as a coequal branch of government  the American people expect the Congress to have a say in a deal that could potentially have vast national security implications     said Snowe           It is clear that the Bush Administration has failed to adequately address valid national security concerns  We will do everything possible to make sure the Administration conducts the mandatory investigation required under the law and does not compromise security at our ports   said Clinton          Coburn said    Handing the keys to U S  strategic ports to a regime that recognized the Taliban is not a sound next step in our war against terror   I urge Secretary Snow to investigate this agreement that could seriously undermine our national security             Collins stated    It appears that this transaction has received far less scrutiny than it should have   This legislation contains several provisions that will require the Administration to work more closely with Congress ensuring appropriate consideration of homeland security concerns             At the beginning of this week Schumer was joined by House Homeland Security Chairman Peter King in offering this bipartisan bill on an emergency basis when the Senate returns to session on Monday   The bill has broad support in the Senate and the House and has been bolstered by statements of Frist and Hastert calling for similar action quickly            Over the last two weeks since Schumer first criticized this deal  a litany of homeland security professionals have come out questioning the deal including former DHS Secretary Tom Ridge  former DHS Inspector General Clark Kent Ervin  and governors and mayors of both parties around the nation          The bipartisan emergency bill will        Require the President to place a stay on DP World  s takeover of P ports         Require the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States commence an immediate 45 day investigation on the takeover  s effects on national security   The bill also requires CFIUS to coordinate with other agencies  such as the Coast Guard  and to take in to consideration past security assessments of ports operated by DP World         Require the Secretaries of Homeland Security and the Treasury to prepare a full report and brief members of Congress on their findings         Upon receiving the report  Congress would have the authority to disapprove the sale within thirty days
