February 8  2006 Senators Clinton  Roberts Urge the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention to Make Flu Vaccine Production and Distribution a Priority                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC    Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  and Pat Roberts  KS  sent a letter to Dr  Julie Gerberding  Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  underscoring the need to shore up our seasonal flu vaccine production and distribution system to ensure we have the infrastructure needed to respond to both seasonal and pandemic influenza   Senators Clinton and Roberts have introduced legislation that would make these needed fixes           Specifically  the Clinton Roberts bill  the Influenza Vaccine Security Act  addresses the causes of the influenza shortage by bringing increased stability to our nation  s seasonal flu vaccine market  The bill provides a framework through which our public health officials can track vaccines to from the factory to the provider and to make sure high priority populations are vaccinated  The bill also provides technical assistance to companies that wish to produce vaccine domestically  and it will increase education about the importance of obtaining seasonal flu vaccines          The full text of the letter to Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention follows          Dear Dr  Gerberding          During the recent National Influenza Vaccine Summit  cosponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  and the American Medical Association  AMA   we were pleased to see a major topic of discussion was our nation  s continued difficulties to effectively track and distribute seasonal influenza vaccine  We would urge you to heed the suggestions of several summit participants and implement  as quickly as possible  a system through which we can track shipments of vaccine from the factory to the provider           Since 2000  our nation has faced multiple shortages of seasonal flu vaccine  This year  delays in vaccine production  combined with heightened demand for seasonal flu vaccine  resulted in many seniors and chronically ill individuals experiencing long waits to obtain flu shots  Many providers have contacted us to express frustration at their continuing inability to accurately predict at which point they may be able to provide needed supplies of influenza vaccine to their patients  At a time when we routinely use tracking to trace deliveries of other goods in the private market  we still cannot accurately predict when a vaccine order placed in the summer might actually be delivered to a provider in the winter  To this end  it certainly makes sense for your agency  which recommends that priority populations get vaccinated  create a market in which patients and providers can easily follow these recommendations and get the vaccines to those who need it most           In order to address these concerns  we introduced the Influenza Vaccine Security Act  This legislation would establish a tracking system through which we could better trace the distribution of vaccine from the factory to the provider and identify counties with high numbers of priority populations  With such a system in place  we could easily determine in times of shortage where vaccine was most needed and facilitate distribution to those areas  All of this could take place in a matter of hours  rather than days or weeks          We understand that you are exploring options to implement such a system and would urge you to look at the model established in our bill  The tracking system in this legislation builds upon the current private system of distribution  and has received the support of vaccine manufacturers and public health groups  Linking information through a national database can be done in a manner that does not jeopardize free market competition           At a time when our nation is facing the threat of avian influenza  and is increasing preparations for a pandemic outbreak  we must first act to strengthen the capacity of the public health infrastructure to respond to seasonal influenza  Pandemic influenza will place a great strain on our nation  and our public health system will need to respond to unforeseen complications for which we cannot plan  It simply makes sense to establish a tracking system for vaccine distribution that can be used in both seasonal and pandemic events and have a system that is already operational  rather than rely on untried mechanisms in an emergency situation where we will already be facing multiple obstacles to delivery of health care             We look forward to learning further of the results of your discussions at this summit  and  urge you to follow the immediate recommendations to develop an influenza vaccine tracking system  We remain committed to working with the CDC to ensure that all Americans who wish to receive an influenza vaccine will be able to obtain one  Thank you           Sincerely
