July 2  2007 Statement of Hillary Clinton on President Bush s Decision to Commute the Sentence of Scooter Libby                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Today s decision is yet another example that this Administration simply considers itself above the law  This case arose from the Administration s politicization of national security intelligence and its efforts to punish those who spoke out against its policies  Four years into the Iraq war  Americans are still living with the consequences of this White House s efforts to quell dissent  This commutation sends the clear signal that in this Administration  cronyism and ideology trump competence and justice
