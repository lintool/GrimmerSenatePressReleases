April 25  2005 Wall Street To Washington  Social Security Privatization Would Endanger Americans  Retirement Security                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Clinton  Schumer  Wyden join financial experts in cautioning against diverting payroll taxes to stock market in Social Security scheme                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           New York  NY   Today  U S  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY   Chuck Schumer  NY   and Ron Wyden  Ore   will join members of Wall Street s financial services industry as they caution Congress against the privatization of Social Security   Financial leaders   including rising stars on Wall Street   will unveil a letter to Majority Leader Bill Frist and Democratic Leader Harry Reid in which they detail the significant financial risks for individual Americans if Federal payroll taxes are diverted from Social Security into the stock market   and reiterate that private accounts will do nothing to keep the program solvent for future generations         As President Bush attempts to sell his plan to undermine Social Security  we are joined today by financial leaders who aren t buying it   These Wall Street experts are far from bullish about the President s plan   said Senator Clinton    They are joining the growing chorus of voices warning that privatizing Social Security is a bad deal for America s families         Two of these Wall Street experts will speak at the event today  David Shaw  Founder and Chairman of D  E  Shaw   Co   Inc  and a chief architect of the letter  and Ben Appen  a Partner at private investment firm Magnitude Capital          On Wall Street  the biggest mistake you can make is to risk what you can t afford to lose   The President wants millions of Americans to take risks with their minimum retirement security   It s a bad trade for America and we can not let it happen   Appen emphasized        The letter from Wall Street experts expresses serious reservations about the President s plan to privatize Social Security   The more than 40 signers underscore that they  find no reason to believe that privatization would address current concerns regarding the long term stability of the Social Security system   Although the fee income associated with managing millions of new private accounts might well represent a windfall for those of us who work on Wall Street  we cannot in good conscience recommend privatization as a means of protecting the financial security of American retirees or controlling the government expenditures required to provide a given level of benefits          When the Finance Committee began looking at Social Security  I assumed there would be automatic support on Wall Street for the President s private accounts proposal   but instead of rave reviews I kept hearing reservations from market leaders   said Senator Wyden    Congress should take this good financial advice and reject schemes that would make Social Security less secure and no more solvent than it is today         Added Senator Chuck Schumer   This letter is another example of how wide and deep the opposition to the President s Social Security privatization plan really is   The experts in finance on Wall Street  the American people  and Democrats and many Republicans in the Senate are in agreement   privatization would be an economic bust and a public policy disaster         Tomorrow  the Senate will begin hearings on the President s plan  following a 60 day tour by administration officials that have revealed deep misgivings about the President s plan across the country        Senators Clinton  Schumer and Wyden today reemphasized that Social Security should be strengthened for the long term  beginning with shoring up the Social Security Trust Fund           Please see attached letter          April 25  2005         The Honorable Bill  Frist                                        Majority Leader                                      United States Senate  509 Hart Senate Office Building                                       Washington  DC 20510    The Honorable Harry Reid  Minority Leader  United States Senate  528 Hart Senate Office Building  Washington  DC 20510       Dear Leaders Frist and Reid      We are writing to express our serious reservations regarding the President  s proposal for the privatization of Social Security   While we are strongly supportive of efforts to ensure the long term solvency of the Social Security system  we find little evidence to suggest that privatization would help to achieve this goal        Proponents of privatization have argued that redirecting a portion of Social Security payroll taxes into private investment accounts would allow investors to increase the ultimate value of their retirement savings by investing in equity securities   While this might be the case for some individuals under certain market circumstances  others  retiring at different times under different market conditions  might suffer the loss of a significant fraction of their retirement income due to the unpredictable nature and timing of the stock market   Although an investor whose minimal retirement needs have already been met may well wish to include a substantial equity component within his or her remaining investment portfolio  the redirection of Social Security funds toward riskier asset classes could jeopardize the system  s traditional role as a   safety net    for all American workers        Even if we ignore the issue of risk and assume a higher rate of return for equities  the redirection of funds from the Social Security system to private investment accounts cannot be expected to help address any future mismatch between the benefits paid to retirees and the revenues allocated for the provision of such benefits   After taking into consideration the effects of transition related federal borrowing  and in the absence of separate policy changes that  for example  increase the national savings rate or cause capital to be allocated more efficiently  privatization would have no net effect on the amount of capital available to the nation  s economy  on the aggregate net worth of its citizens  or on the cost of its retirement programs   The adoption of private investment accounts would result in only a reallocation of risk and returns  and would not lead to the creation of any new wealth that might be used to protect the benefits received by future retirees or reduce the net cost of providing such benefits        In short  we find no reason to believe that privatization would address current concerns regarding the long term stability of the Social Security system   Although the fee income associated with managing millions of new private accounts might well represent a windfall for those of us who work on Wall Street  we cannot in good conscience recommend privatization as a means of protecting the financial security of American retirees or controlling the government expenditures required to provide a given level of benefits        Benjamin S  Appen  Charles Ardai  Theodore Aronson  Trey Beck   John Bingaman  Randall
