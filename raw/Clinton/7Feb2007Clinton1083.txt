February 7  2007 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Speaks on Iraq on the Senate Floor                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Mr  President  we are all well aware in this chamber that our country finds itself in a deepening crisis in Iraq  and we find ourselves at a moment of decision in the United States Senate           Nearly four years ago  our President rushed us into war in Iraq  a war now longer than American involvement in World War II  which next month will actually exceed the length of our own Civil War  For four years  members on both sides of the aisle have watched with shock and dismay as our President has made mistake  after misjudgment  after miscalculation           Even before the invasion ended  the Administration rejected the voluminous plans drawn up by the State Department to deal with the chaotic aftermath  The successful examples of the U S  experience in Bosnia and Kosovo during the 1990s were summarily rejected  State Department and other officials with experience in nation building were blackballed in favor of inexperienced ideologues who were selected on the basis of political litmus tests  including answering questions about whether they were for or against Roe v  Wade and whether they had voted for George W  Bush           Despite the urgent warnings of Army Chief of Staff Eric Shinseki and other senior military commanders  the necessary number of troops to ensure security and stability were not sent at the start of the conflict  Our men and women in uniform were ordered into harm s way without the necessary body armor or armored vehicles  a mortal error I have tried to correct time and again since I first learned of it  The strategic blunders now fill an entire library shelf of books  and they are certainly too numerous for me to list in the time allotted here           Through these four years  there has also been another abdication of responsibility  That was the failure of this Congress to engage in its constitutional obligation of the majority s refusal to hold the Administration accountable  In the election last year  the American people decided that the status quo was no longer acceptable  So we have a new Congress  and it is past time that we in this chamber do our duty to balance the President and provide a check against his failed policy in Iraq  There is a majority against this situation in Iraq  there is a bipartisan consensus in this chamber as well  The resolution reflects that consensus as it reflects the overwhelming majority of Americans  But a partisan minority seeking to shield the Administration s continuing failure in Iraq seeks to thwart the bipartisan majority and the will of the American people           This is not a debate about abstractions  I have seen the consequences of our involvement in Iraq  as have many of my fellow Senators  Three weeks ago  I visited Iraq to express gratitude to our soldiers  to meet with Iraqi leaders and U S  commanders  and our troops on the ground  What I saw and what I did not see underscored my concerns  I saw American servicemen and women performing their duty admirably  but I did not see a strategy that under the current circumstances has much chance of success           The collective analysis of our intelligence community in the latest National Intelligence Estimate is that the term  civil war  does not adequately capture the complexity of the conflict In Iraq  The bipartisan Baker Hamilton Commission said  the situation in Iraq is grave and deteriorating  Yet the President s response to the bipartisan commission and the latest National Intelligence Estimate does not match the urgency that is described  The so called surge is not a new strategy  but a tactic that has been tried and failed           The absence of leadership on the part of the President leaves Congress no choice but to demonstrate the leadership that the American people and the reality on the ground demand  The previous two Congresses abdicated their duty  We must not          Every single day  our feet sink deeper into the sands  Every day the crisis worsens  To hide from this debate with our troops in such danger is wrong  plain and simple  The crisis in Iraq has fostered a crisis of democracy here at home  The American people expect a debate  Our troops are owed a debate  And our constitution commands that we debate  But a partisan minority  acting at the behest of the Administration  is standing in the way  This amounts to a gag rule on our democracy  contrary to the national security interests of the United States           Even though America voted for a new direction in Iraq  even though the majority of Senators oppose escalation in Iraq  we cannot get the Republicans to allow us to take a symbolic vote to condemn the escalation  much less a real vote to stop it  This resolution deserves a debate  it deserves a vote  and it deserves passage           Now  there are those in the chamber who invokes our brave troops  suggesting that a debate on the most important issue facing our country and facing our troops would somehow undermine the mission and weaken our nation  It is a pernicious  shameful argument  and it is dead wrong  Our democracy is stronger than that  and the American people and our troops deserve better than that           You know  our troops understand we are debating this war  We re debating it not just in this chamber  we re debating it in kitchen table conversations and around water coolers and standing in line at supermarkets  We re debating this war everywhere Americans gather  Indeed  our troops are debating this war  and the American people understand that it is the policy that undermines our national security and interests  not a vote disapproving the policy          This debate and this resolution have merit and purpose and it will  if permitted to go forward  begin the process of changing the policy  Otherwise  why would the Administration and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle fought so hard to prevent us from having a debate and a vote  Because they understand that this will be the first step to restore our strength and renew our leadership around the world  to begin redeploying our troops out of Iraq and start on the long road to undoing the damage brought by the President  to America s leadership around the world           If you believe the escalation is the right strategy  then cast your vote for it  But if you believe  as the majority in this chamber believe  that escalation is not the right strategy  then cast your vote against it  But standing on the sidelines is no way to stand up for the troops           Now  there are many  both in the chamber and outside  who would wish to go further than this resolution and look for ways to bind the actions of the President and to require him to change course  I understand and agree with the frustration that has afflicted many of us in dealing with the President s policy  but if we can get a bipartisan vote against escalation  it will be the first time the Senate has exercised its constitutional responsibility to be a check and balance on the President  The first step for the Senate will be a giant leap toward accountability and toward the right end to this war           There is a big difference between calling for the end of this war and doing the difficult  painstaking work of building the political will within the Congress to take action  We  in the Senate  entrusted by our constituents to cast tough votes  should not have the luxury of standing outside the arena and lobbing criticism from within  Once we pass this resolution  we should go further  Rather than an escalation of US troops  which will not contribute to fundamentally changing the conditions on the ground  we should put pressure on the Iraqi government in a way that they will understand there are consequences to their empty promises and their continued inaction           Last week  the National Intelligence Council released the unclassified key judgments of the National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq  That presents the consensus views of the United States intelligence community  and it underscores the need for a political solution  The NIE States that in the coming 12 to 18 months  the overall security situation will continue to deteriorate at rates comparable to the latter part of 2006  And ot goes on further to say that even if violence is diminished  given the current winner takes all attitude and sectarian animosities infecting the political scene  Iraqi leaders will be hard pressed to achieve sustained political reconciliation in the time frame of the estimate  namely  a year to a year and a half  Even if  the intelligence experts argue  the escalation results in greater security  their best judgment is that the bloodshed and violence will continue to spiral out of control           So what should we do  Well  many of us believe    and we ve been arguing for this and voting for this for more than a year and a half    that we have to chart a new course that emphasizes greater Iraqi responsibility  I still believe that is the path we should be taking  Instead  the President has chosen a very narrow course that relies heavily on American military force           I will be introducing legislation that I think offers a better alternative  First  my legislation will cap the number of troops in Iraq as of January 1  and will require the Administration to seek Congressional authorization for any additional troops  The President has finally said this is not an open ended commitment in Iraq  but he is providing the Iraqis with an open ended presence of American troops           Second  as a means to increase our leverage with the Iraqi government and to clearly send a message that there are consequences to their inaction  I would impose conditions for continued funding of the Iraqi security forces and the private contractors working for the Iraqis  My legislation would require certification that the security forces were free of sectarian and militia influence and were actually assuming greater responsibility for Iraqi security along with other conditions  We must not let US funds  taxpayer funds  be used to train members of sectarian militias who are responsible for so much of the violence in Iraq  Unfortunately  it appears that our funds to Iraqi security forces may be going to the people we are trying to restrain  A news report last week in an article entitled   Mahdi Army Gains Strength Through Unwitting Aid Of US   reported that the U S  military drive to train and equip Iraq security forces has unwittingly strengthened anti American  Shiite Muslim cleric Muqtada al Sadr s Mahdi Army militia  which has been battling to take over much of the capital city as American forces are trying to secure it  According to this news report  U S  Army commanders  and enlisted men who are patrolling east of Baghdad said al Sadr s militia s had heavily infiltrated the Iraqi police and Army units that they ve trained and armed  Said one soldier   they ll wave at us during the day and shoot at us during the night            We need to inform the Iraqi government in no uncertain terms that there are consequences    terms that there are consequences  that we will take funds away from their troops  not from our troops  many of whom still lack armored vehicles and counterinsurgency measure devices and communications equipment  And we will not fund the Iraqis if our troops are going to enter into sectarian battles where some of the participants have received American training and support           Third  I would hold the Administration accountable for their empty promises as well  My bill requires the Bush Administration to certify that Iraq has disarmed the militias  has ensured that a law has finally been passed for the equitable sharing of oil revenues  that the Iraqi government  under American influence and even pressure  has made the constitutional changes necessary to ensure rights for minority communities  that the de Baathification process has been reversed to allow teachers  professionals  and others who join the Baath party as a means to get a job to serve in the Iraqi government  I would also require the Administration to engage in a regional diplomatic initiative including all of Iraq s neighbors to address Iraq s future and to understand and convey clearly that the United States expects Iraq s neighbors in the stability and security of the new Iraqi state  If these conditions are not met or are not on their way to being met within six months  a new Congressional authorization requirement would be triggered           Finally  I would prohibit any spending to increase troop levels unless  and until  the Secretary of Defense certifies that our American troops will have the proper training and equipment for whatever mission they are ordered to fulfill  Yesterday I read the classified report outlining the findings by the Department of Defense s Inspector General about the problems that have been faced by our troops getting the equipment they desperately need in combat areas like Iraq  The Inspector General did not have the full cooperation of the Department of Defense and it is heartbreaking that the Inspector General could conclude that the U S  military still has failed to equip our soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan  especially for the kind of warfare that they are confronting with IEDs and insurgents who are attacking them in asymmetric  unconventional warfare           This report comes on the heals of an article in The Washington Post last week entitled   Equipment for Troops is Lacking  Troops Must Make Do  Officials say   The Washington Post story raised serious questions about the adequacy of the supply of up armored humvees and trucks  One of our Generals is quoted as saying that he doesn t have the equipment that our forces need and they will have to go into battle with what they have           On my way back from Iraq and Afghanistan  I stopped at Landstuhl Hospital in Germany to visit with some of our wounded soldiers  I met with one young man who was lying in his bed with his injuries that he had suffered from one of the shape charges  these new  more advanced  more sophisticated command controlled IEDs  the Improvised Explosive Devices  He told me that the armored fully equipped humvee that saved his life and that of the life    the lives of his buddies who were with him  But he also told me that not everybody that he served with had that kind of protection because there weren t enough of those armored vehicles to go around           Madam President  I do not believe that the Congress can shirk its responsibility  It is past time that we live up to our constitutional responsibility  If I had been President in October of 2002  I would have never asked for authority to divert our attention from Afghanistan to Iraq  and I certainly would never have started this war  But we are where we are  and this Congress must deliver a strategy to help us end this war in the right way and begin returning our troops home           So on this most important issue of our time  I call on my colleagues  not to hide from this debate  but to welcome it  To welcome the opportunity to set forth whatever one s opinions might be  because this debate is about more than our policy in Iraq  It is about the role and responsibility of this august institution  Great debates in our past have not only moved public opinion but furthered the progress of our country  This debate is not merely about whether or not the President should escalate troops into Iraq  whether he has failed to grasp the complexity of the situation we confront in Iraq and to take every diplomatic  political  economic  and military strategy available to him  but it s really about our democracy itself  We should consider this resolution  And I hope that we will           Our duty is rooted in the faith entrusted to us by our constituents and enshrined in our constitution  When we think about the patriotism and bravery  the humor and resolve  the optimism and strength of our soldiers  Marines  airmen  and sailors  our active duty  our Guard and Reserves  I think it humbles us all  But it comes out of this great democratic tradition that we are all blessed to be a part of  I hope that we have the opportunity in the next days to do our duty  just as the men and women who are serving us have done and are doing theirs           A week ago I was privileged to go to San Antonio for the opening of a remarkable center called the Center of the Intrepid  It is a new state of the art facility devoted to the rehabilitation and recovery of our wounded heroes  It was funded by contributions from more than 600 000 Americans  It was not built by our government  It was built by our citizens  It is not only going to be a place of great hope and healing for the brave men and women who have given their full measure  but it will also stand as a symbol of our democracy  of our values  of people coming together across our country  a unique partnership that you find nowhere else in the world except here  As I sat on the stage during the ceremonies for the opening of this new rehabilitation center  I watched the hundreds of young men and women who had been injured march in   in some cases wheeled in  and take their place in the audience  I believe they are owed this debate  and certainly all those who are currently serving and the thousands who are on their way to carry out this escalation strategy deserve it even more  So  Madam President  I hope we will have a chance to express the will of our constituents  our deeply held opinions  and participate in a debate that is historic and necessary  That is the least we can do                 Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning the war in Iraq
