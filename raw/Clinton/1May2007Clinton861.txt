May 1  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Need for Comprehensive Immigration Reform                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC   Today s marches underscore the importance of comprehensive immigration reform   Our immigration system is broken  and it is past time that we came together and implemented an effective policy which respects our immigrant heritage  the rule of law  and human dignity   That is what I am committed to achieving           A comprehensive solution to our immigration crisis must include strengthening our borders  greater cooperation with our neighbors  strict but fair enforcement of our laws  federal assistance to state and local governments  strict penalties for those who exploit undocumented workers  and a path to earned legal status for those who are here  working hard  paying taxes  respecting the law  and willing to meet a high bar  including learning English   The solution must also protect the sanctity of families and repair the broken  unfair bureaucratic system that forces citizens and lawful immigrants to live apart from their spouses and children            Although many Republicans have tried to derail attempts at comprehensive immigration reform  I am committed to working with my colleagues to create an immigration system that respects our values   We must insist on comprehensive immigration reform that protects our homeland security and protects the dignity of millions of families who live here   There is a smart and effective  comprehensive solution to the impasse we face  and I will continue to pursue it
