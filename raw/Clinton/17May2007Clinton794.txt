May 17  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Comprehensive Immigration Reform                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Washington  DC    This afternoon  a bipartisan group of Senators  who have been working closely in conjunction with the Administration  announced that they had reached an agreement on a comprehensive approach for reforming our broken immigration system            As I have long maintained  comprehensive immigration reform must have as essential ingredients a strengthening of our borders  greater cross cooperation with our neighbors  strict but fair enforcement of our laws  federal assistance to our state and local governments  strict penalties for those who exploit undocumented workers  and a path to earned legal status for those who are here  working hard  paying taxes  respecting the law  and willing to meet a high bar   In particular  we must also ensure that any bill protects the sanctity of families and does not lead to the creation of a new underclass in our country          I will scrutinize carefully the proposed compromise to see if it honors our nation s principles and proud immigrant heritage while also respecting the rule of law
