                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Graham  Clinton  DeWine  Leahy Secure TRICARE for National Guard and Reserve                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC    The United States Senate last night approved the Fiscal Year 2006 Defense Authorization bill            The legislation improves benefits for military personnel including a provision offered by U S  Senators Lindsey Graham  R South Carolina   Hillary Clinton  D New York   Mike DeWine  R Ohio   and Patrick Leahy  D Vermont  to expand TRICARE to all drilling reservists            Graham  Clinton  DeWine  and Leahy have worked together and with other Senators to expand access to health care for members of the National Guard and Reserve who are playing an ever increasing and historic role in the global War on Terror   The Senators noted that Guardsmen and Reservists now make up approximately 40 percent of American forces in Iraq            Our work reflects a significant triumph for the Guard  Reserves and their families     said Graham  chairman of the Armed Services Subcommittee on Personnel     Now  after years of relative neglect  these soldiers   health care coverage and benefits are more in line with their service to our nation   This year  s bill provides continuous health care coverage for all drilling reservists  an important improvement over what we were able to accomplish last year               I am pleased that we have made further progress towards our goal of increasing access to health benefits for our National Guard and Reserve and their families in New York and around the country     Senator Clinton said    Providing the Guard and Reserves  as well as their families  with adequate support and benefits is the least that a grateful nation can do               We know how important it is that we fund our military hardware and base installations   At the same time  we can  t ignore our military personnel   We can  t ignore those who volunteer to protect us     stated Senator Mike DeWine     It  s the least we can do  particularly as we continue to rely more and more on our Reserve and National Guard              This is a measurable step forward for readiness and for fairness for the Guard and its people     said Leahy  the co chair of the Senate  s National Guard Caucus     Ensuring that every member of the Guard and Reserve has access to affordable health insurance is vital to the well being of this essential force   At a time when the troops of our Guard and Reserve are contributing so much to the war efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan  as well as protecting us at home  this package of new health insurance benefits will make a real difference  and it  s the least they deserve           Under the expansion of TRICARE championed by the Senators  all members of the Selected Reserve are eligible to enroll in the military health care program for a monthly premium   The premiums are based on categories of eligibility               Category 1   Members of the Selected Reserve who are called to active duty qualify for TRICARE Reserve Select  TRS    Under this program  established last year  a reservist would accumulate one year of TRS coverage for every 90 days of active duty service   Monthly premiums during the years of accumulated eligibility are only 28 percent of the program cost  The government picks up the remaining 72 percent   As has always been the case  coverage is free of charge while on active duty   This bill now permits accumulation of earned periods of coverage for frequently deployed personnel   In addition  it authorizes 6 months of transitional coverage for family members following the death of the Reserve member  if the member dies while in an inactive status                Category 2   Members of the Selected Reserve who are not called to active duty  and who otherwise do not qualify for health insurance due to unemployment or lack of employer provided coverage  are eligible to enroll in TRICARE for a 50 percent cost sharing premium   The government will pay the remaining 50 percent                Category 3   Members of the Selected Reserve who do not fit into either of the above categories but would like to participate in TRICARE are eligible to do so for an 85 percent cost share   Employers are allowed and encouraged to contribute to the reservist  s share   The government contributes 15 percent of the costs             I will continue to work to improve benefits available to members of the Guard and Reserve     said Graham     The nation will continue to need their services  in large numbers  in fighting the War on Terror   I am proud of and appreciate the progress we  ve made this year with the Senate and Bush Administration working together               I am pleased that the Senate joined me in taking this important step forward for our National Guard and Reserve members and their families   We have made it possible for more members of the Guard and Reserve and their families to access the healthcare benefits they need and deserve and I will keep fighting to further expand their healthcare benefits   said Senator Clinton             Recent reports indicate about 40 percent of the junior enlisted lack any civilian health insurance and this TRICARE expansion will help them and their families receive needed coverage   We must ensure greater continuity in health care for our Guardsmen and Reservists  which will enhance overall military medical readiness   This is both a readiness and retention issue   Now more than ever  we need to provide our Reserve and Guard personnel with adequate support   Ensuring our servicemen and women have access to healthcare insurance is the right thing to do     added Senator DeWine          The defense bill authorized additional benefits for the men and women serving our nation in uniform   Among these important changes were               A 3 1 percent pay raise for all military personnel                Payment of   matching fund    contributions of up to 5 percent of basic pay for first term enlistees who participate in the Thrift Savings Plan   The TSP is a 401 k  retirement plan available to all federal employees                 Increases in maximum amounts of assignment incentive pay and hardship duty pay                 60 million increase in child care and family assistance services to active duty and Reserve military families                Critical skills retention bonus of up to  100 000 over a career for members of the Selected Reserve                Increases TRICARE benefits for the surviving children of members who die on active duty                Increases to  100 000 in the death gratuity allowance payable to survivors of all active duty military decedents  including retroactive payment to October 7  2001  the date of commencement of Operation Enduring Freedom                Directs the establishment of a uniform Department policy on casualty assistance to improve the services provided to survivors and next of kin of military members killed on active duty                In addition the bill authorizes increases in the active duty end strength of 10 000 for the Army and 1 000 for the Marine Corps           The bill has been passed by the House and is expected to be signed into law by President Bush in the coming days
