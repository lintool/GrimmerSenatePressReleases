

                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC    Today  U S  Senators George V  Voinovich  R OH   Thomas Carper  D DE   Hillary R  Clinton  D NY  and Norm Coleman  R MN  introduced the National Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2007  legislation aimed at addressing the deteriorating condition of our nation s roads  bridges  drinking water systems  dams and other public works  If enacted  the bill will establish a National Commission on Infrastructure of the United States  The commission will be charged with aiding in the nation s economic growth and ensuring the nation s infrastructure meets current and future demands           The tragedy of Hurricane Katrina made painfully clear the urgent need for improvements to our aging infrastructure   Senator Voinovich said   Our infrastructure is collapsing due to insufficient funding  And the deterioration of our nation s waterways and infrastructure systems are impacting our economy  our environment and the overall welfare of the American people  This legislation gets to the heart of the problem by establishing a commission that will provide concrete recommendations for future infrastructure needs  When enacted  this commission will lead the way in providing long term solutions to the dire problems we currently face             The future health of our economy and safety of the American people requires proper maintenance of our infrastructure  whether flood control  transportation or water quality   said Senator Carper   No nation can be prosperous without these fundamental building blocks  As we look for the best way to address the needs of our country with tighter and tighter budgets  we need to ensure we protect communities by properly maintaining our current infrastructure and setting targeted priorities for future investments            Throughout history our nation s economic strength has been inexorably linked to the investments made in our public infrastructure   said Senator Clinton   From the Transcontinental Railroad to the National Highway System  the public sector s investments in our roads  waterways  railways and aviation systems have built the bedrock strength of the American economy  It is time to make sure that we maintain that strong foundation  To ensure our nation s future prosperity  we need to ensure that we continue to make the right investments to rebuild and strengthen our aging infrastructure  This is a challenge we must meet head on in the greatest tradition of America             America s infrastructure is critical to both the development of our communities and the economic competitiveness of our domestic industries   said Senator Coleman   Basic infrastructure including roads  waterways  and community infrastructure are the life blood of our farmers  our businesses and our rural and urban communities  By creating a commission to address aging infrastructure  we can identify new ways to ensure the economic viability of America s for years to come           This legislation is the first important step in revitalizing our nation s weakening infrastructure  Hurricane Katrina made evident the serious need for the repair and improvement of our nation s aging infrastructure and waterway systems  The backlog of unfunded Army Corps of Engineers operation and maintenance projects mandated by Congress is  1 2 billion            The bill would mandate the               Establishment of the National Commission on the Infrastructure of the United States to ensure that the nation s infrastructure meets current and future demands and facilitates economic growth               Completion of a study by February 2010 that will address all matters relating to the state of the nation s infrastructure  including  capacity of infrastructure improvements to sustain current and anticipated economic development  the age  condition and capacity of public infrastructure  repair and maintenance needs  financing methods  and investment requirements               Development of recommendations for a federal plan outlining infrastructure priorities  and              Completion of a report to Congress by February 2010 that will detail infrastructure legislation deemed necessary for the next five  15  30 and 50 years          The National Infrastructure Improvement Act was first introduced in the 109th Congress  The legislation has gained broad support from numerous organizations  such as the U S  Conference of Mayors  the National Association of Counties and the U S  Chamber of Commerce
