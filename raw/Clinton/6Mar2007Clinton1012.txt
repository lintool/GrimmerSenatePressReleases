March 6  2007 Senators Clinton  Schumer and Representatives Reynolds  Slaughter  Higgins Re Introduce Legislation to Compensate Nuclear Workers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC    Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles E  Schumer joined Representatives Thomas Reynolds  Louise Slaughter and Brian Higgins in re introducing legislation to reform the compensation program for nuclear workers at Bethlehem Steel and other former New York atomic weapons production facilities  The bill would enable employees to be added to a  special exposure cohort  and receive compensation under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program if exposure records do not enable case by case decisions to be made            It is way past time to right the wrong that has been done to our former nuclear workers and their families who have not received the compensation they deserve  We simply cannot let this outrageous injustice continue any longer  This bill will ensure these Cold War heroes are given the justice and closure they deserve and are not penalized because  through no fault of their own  exposure records are inadequate   said Senator Clinton             Our bill would correct years of injustice for Western New York s nuclear workers   Senator Schumer said   These Cold War heroes became dangerously ill developing the country s nuclear weapons program  and should not have to wait a minute longer for help   This bill would finally put them on the path to getting the recognition and compensation they deserve             This legislation will ensure that these workers have the ability to receive a fair and impartial review and receive the compensation they deserve   said Congressman Thomas M  Reynolds    Furthermore it simplifies the process under which these exposed workers can be classified as special exposure cohort status   The federal government has an obligation to ensure a thorough review of the claims submitted  as Congress intended when we passed this important legislation in 2000   Anything less is unacceptable            The workers of Bethlehem Steel  Linde Ceramics  and many other Department of Energy facilities deserve immediate compensation  Despite many incidences of work related illnesses and deaths  employees across this country have not found relief because of insufficient records that not only delay site profiles  but also make dose reconstruction virtually impossible   said Rep  Slaughter   This bill  by allowing Special Exposure Cohort status designation to specific facilities  will help employees receive the benefits promised to them in a timely manner            Western New Yorkers exposed to toxic radiation while working at Bethlehem Steel have waited for too long for compensation from the federal government   said Rep  Higgins    It is time that we stop denying these workers the help they deserve  it is the least we can do to help them cope with their terrible suffering           Congress passed the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act  EEOICPA  in 2000 to compensate workers who contracted radioactive cancer  beryllium disease or chronic silicosis after working at sites that performed nuclear weapons work during World War II and the Cold War  Under EEOICPA  former nuclear workers or their survivors were eligible to file claims with the US Department of Labor  DOL  for individual payments of  150 000  as well as medical benefits  To file a claim  patients or their surviving families needed to provide proper documentation of their illness and employment history           Claims are decided by the DOL and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  NIOSH  by using available records about work conditions and employment history  Using these records  NIOSH estimates the radiation doses received by each worker and then determines whether that radiation exposure was likely to have caused the worker s illness  This  dose reconstruction  process has been time consuming and controversial  particularly at facilities like Bethlehem Steel in Lackawanna  New York  where workers did not wear individual radiation monitors  and there was minimal monitoring of ambient radiation  For Bethlehem Steel workers  compensation decisions have been made using a radiation exposure model that relies on data from another facility  the Simonds Saw facility in Lockport  New York           The bill re introduced today would amend the criteria by which employees can be added to a  special exposure cohort   Being added to a cohort means that employees do not have to go through a  dose reconstruction  process  Instead  if a person has an eligible cancer and worked at a facility when weapons work was performed  their cancer is presumed to have been caused by workplace exposure and the person s claim is paid  Under the legislation  workers would be added to a special cohort if              they worked at an eligible facility for an   aggregate of at least 250 days  and                fewer than 50 percent of the total number of the workers at the facility were individually monitored on a regular basis for exposure to internal and external ionizing radiation using reliable methods under a formal health physics program or                individual internal and external exposure records for radiation are non existent or are not available  or                to the extent that a portion of individual internal or external records are available for that period from such facility  the exposure to radiation at such facility cannot be reliably determined for greater than 2 3 percent of workers           The bill also directs the Secretary of Labor to apply these criteria to the Bethlehem Steel facility within 90 days of enactment  Because individual records are not available at Bethlehem Steel  workers would qualify for inclusion in a special cohort under the legislation if they worked at the facility for an aggregate of 250 days during 1949 1952  Based on draft site profiles prepared by NIOSH for the Linde Ceramics and Simonds Saw facilities  it appears that many workers from these facilities would qualify under the legislation as well  Because these and other New York facilities are not as far along in the claims process as Bethlehem Steel  it is impossible to determine exactly how the legislation would apply  However  it could assist workers across New York        Click here to view the list of facilities with more than 20 claims filed
