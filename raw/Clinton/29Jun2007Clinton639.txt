Fire Department      The bill will now proceed to the Senate Floor as the next step in the appropriations process   Schumer and Clinton worked closely with members of the Appropriations Committee to include funding for the project in this years spending bill    This is great news for Western New York  said Schumer   These projects will address many of the environmental problems facing local communities in the region while creating new jobs that will boost the economy   Furthermore the new camera system in the City of Buffalo will help local law enforcement crack down on crime and increase security throughout the city  I am also pleased with the funding for the Father Mychal Judge Center at St  Bonaventure University   Father Mychal Judge was a supreme humanitarian in the true Franciscan tradition  This center will ensure that his legacy will continue for future generations    I am pleased that we were able to secure the Committees approval for these funds that will help bolster these critical infrastructure and development projects  Funding for the Chautauqua Landfill project will help the County with an innovative project developing much needed alternative energy from landfill and the funds for Smokes Creek will help repair years of environmental damage  The commitment to funding for the Buffalo River will be critical in enabling the Army Corps of Engineers and Buffalo Niagara Riverkeeper to continue working to clean up the Buffalo River which is a key environmental priority and a necessary step for us to realize the real potential of this resource to the city  I will closely monitor this program as it moves through Congress to ensure that we get the funds we need to continue this essential restoration project  The funds for the City of Buffalo are part of our collective commitment to helping the city deal with its unique status on a busy border in the fight against local crime and in the protection of our homeland  These kinds of federal funds are essential to our partnerships with local governments as we work together to invest in community and regional infrastructure projects for the future  Senator Clinton said  I am very pleased that we can support the Father Mychal Judge Center at St  Bonaventure and the possibilities it will mean not only for the students here in America but for those in Northern Ireland who will travel to Western New York  We have made great progress in Northern Ireland and I know that this program will serve as an important exchange of ideas and experiences beneficial to all students named in honor of a hero to many of us      Chautauqua County  NY  Landfill at Ellery will use  500 000 in funds to finance  design  permit  construct  own and operate a Landfill Gas Utilization Project for the Chautauqua County Landfill at Ellery   The requested funds will be used to meet the Countys obligations by providing a suitable site for the project including necessary road improvements  providing condensate disposal for the gas collection system  managing off site soil gas migration and fugitive emissions  operating  maintaining  and expanding the gas collection pipe network     The City of Buffalo will use federal funds for Law Enforcement Technology   Funds will be used to assist the Buffalo Police Department in its crime fighting efforts through the development and implementation of a camera system within the City of Buffalo  A  City camera system will support the Mayors Be Safe initiative  a citywide effort for crime fighting with a zero tolerance policy   In addition  as an international border city  surveillance cameras will serve as a protective measure and tool for the police departments continued homeland security efforts  making it more difficult for terrorists to conduct site surveillances or attacks  as well as complementing the Citys terrorism prevention and response efforts     Federal fund will be used at the Buffalo River for an Environmental Dredging project    Black Rock Channel and the Tonawanda Harbor will use  1 045 000 for operations and maintenance projects  The Black Rock Lock and the Black Rock Channel  located where Lake Erie drains into the Niagara River  provide for vessels of all types a protected waterway around the reefs  rapids and fast currents that exist in the upstream portion of the Niagara River  The lock and channel permit pleasure craft and comercial vessels to travel between Buffalo Harbor and Tonawanda Harbor  In combination with the New York Erie Canal  they provide pleasure craft and canal draft vessels an inland water route between Lake Erie and the Atlantic Ocean     Smokes Creek  which runs through property that once housed an integrated steel facility  is in a degraded state  A feasibility study would evaluate relocating the creek to provide environmental and flood control benefits   Federal funds would be used to initiate a Feasibility Study and associated reports to determine the most optimum environmental restoration project  with respect to environmental acceptability and budget priority   Although this project is included in the bill  the final funding amounts will be determined at a later point in the appropriations process     The purpose of the Father Mychal Judge Center is to facilitate an exchange of intellectual  academic  civic  and other resources with partners and institutions located in Northern Ireland in order to promote Northern Irelands growth into a new century and to foster ecumenical citizenship in its students and faculty   St  Bonaventure will cover the costs associated with scholarships and travel for student exchanges  stipends and travel for visiting professorships  salary and travel for program director and staff  promotion of the program  and other miscellaneous costs necessary for the establishment of the program   The program is designed in tribute to Father Mychal Judge  O F M   a member of the Franciscan province  graduate of St  Bonaventure who died in the September 11  2001 attacks at the World Trade Center while serving as a chaplain for the Fire Department of New York    Now that the bills have been approved by the full
