March 8  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on International Women s Day                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC    More than a decade ago  I had the honor of participating at the United Nations  Fourth World Conference on Women  Today  on International Women s Day  we have the opportunity to once again reaffirm the message that human rights are women s rights  and women s rights are human rights           There has been much progress made  The number of women in the Senate and House of Representatives has reached an all time high  According to the United Nations Development Fund for Women  the number of countries that have enacted laws against domestic violence has almost doubled within the past four years  And the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded jointly to the Grameen Bank and its founder  Dr  Muhammad Yunus  in recognition of the impact and importance of microfinance programs  which have helped millions of women and families around the world  But there is still a great deal of work we must undertake to help women achieve equal rights  equal protection  and equal status in their communities          This year s theme for International Women s Day is  Ending Impunity for Violence Against Women and Girls   The silent epidemic of gender based violence affects far too many women and families  both in the United States and around the world  According to a 2005 study by the World Health Organization  more than 50 percent of women in some countries surveyed reported experiencing physical or sexual abuse at the hands of their partners  The same study found that the majority of women who had experienced intimate partner violence did not seek help  owing not only to stigma and fear  but difficulty accessing the services that would enable them to escape such violence          Gender based violence is not only a criminal issue  but a health issue  Women who have experienced domestic violence are at increased risk of contracting HIV  In our efforts to prevent AIDS in the United States and around the world  we need to ensure that women are in position to protect themselves against AIDS without fear of violence or sexual assault           In addition to intimate partner violence  too many women and girls around the world are vulnerable to other forms of violence  According to the United Nations  situations of armed conflict result in increased number of rapes  sexual violence and slavery for women  In some countries  women who have been raped or sexually assaulted are at risk of being murdered in so called  honor killings   which only increase the fear and stigma that women face  UNICEF reports that about three million girls experience female genital cutting every year           But there is hope out there  In the West African countries of Senegal  Burkina Faso  and Guinea  hundreds of communities have pledged to end the practice of female genital cutting  Women who have been subjected to abuse and sexual assault  like Mukhtaran Mai of Pakistan  have turned their tragedies into an opportunity to create positive cultural change  These examples show that we can   and we must   bring this violence out of the shadows  and ensure that violence against women is treated as the crime that it is           I believe that by supporting the brave individuals who stand up and speak out against gender based violence  we can make significant gains in achieving human rights for all women and men  I will work with my colleagues in Congress to support the elimination of violence against women  and help women and girls around the globe live their lives free from the threat of harm
