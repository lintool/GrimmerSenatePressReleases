July 20  2007 Clinton Calls on Gates to Explain Pentagon s Position on Planning for the Redeployment of U S  Forces from Iraq  Renews Call on the Bush Administration to Immediately Provide a Redeployment Strategy                                                                                                                                                                                                           Comes in Light of Alarming Response from Defense Under Secretary Speaking on Behalf of Secretary Gates                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Washington  DC   In light of an unacceptable response from Under Secretary of Defense Eric Edelman regarding the Pentagon s planning for the redeployment of U S  forces from Iraq  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is calling on Defense Secretary Robert M  Gates to explain Edelman s remarks and the Pentagon s position on redeployment planning   In May  Senator Clinton called on Secretary Gates to brief the appropriate oversight committees in Congress  including the Senate Armed Services Committee on which she serves  on what current contingency plans exist for the future withdrawal of United States forces from Iraq   Alternatively  if no such plans exist  she asked for an explanation for the decision not to engage in such planning    In that Letter  Senator Clinton wrote  the seeds of many problems that continue to plague our troops and mission in Iraq were planted in the failure to adequately plan for the conflict and properly equip our men and women in uniform   Congress must be sure that we are prepared to withdraw our forces without any unnecessary danger     This week  responding to her May inquiry on behalf of Secretary Gates  Defense Under Secretary Eric Edelman outrageously and dangerously claimed that congressional oversight emboldens our enemies   a direct contradiction to Secretary Gates himself  who stated in March during testimony before the House Armed Services Committee  I believe that the debate here on the Hill and the issues that have been raised have been helpful in bringing pressure to bear on the Maliki government and on the Iraqis in knowing that there is a very real limit to American patience in this entire enterprise     In her most recent letter to Secretary Gates  Senator Clinton wrote  Redeploying out of Iraq will be difficult and requires careful planning   I continue to call on the Bush Administration to immediately provide a redeployment strategy that will keep our brave men and women safe as they leave Iraq  instead of adhering to a political strategy to attack those who rightfully question their competence and preparedness after years of mistakes and misjudgments   Click here to read both Senator Clinton s May letter to Secretary Gates and the response from Under Secretary Edelman  The full text of her most recent letter to Secretary Gates follows    July 19  2007   The Honorable Robert M  Gates  Secretary of Defense  The United States Department of Defense  The Pentagon  Suite 319  Washington  D C  20301   Dear Mr  Secretary    On May 22  2007  I wrote to you to request that you provide the appropriate oversight committees in Congress  including the Senate Armed Services Committee  with briefings on what current contingency plans exist for the future withdrawal of United States forces from Iraq   Alternatively  if no such plans exist  I asked for an explanation for the decision not to engage in such planning    I am in receipt of a letter from Eric Edelman  the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy who wrote that he was responding on your behalf    Under Secretary Edelmans response did not address the issues raised in my letter and instead made spurious arguments to avoid addressing contingency planning for the withdrawal of U S  forces from Iraq    As I noted in my original letter  the seeds of many problems that continue to plague our troops and mission in Iraq were planted in the failure to adequately plan for the conflict and properly equip our men and women in uniform   Congress must be sure that we are prepared to withdraw our forces without any unnecessary danger    Rather than offer to brief the congressional oversight committees on this critical issue  Under Secretary Edelman  writing on your behalf  instead claims that congressional oversight emboldens our enemies   Under Secretary Edelman has his priorities backward   Open and honest debate and congressional oversight strengthens our nation and supports our military   His suggestion to the contrary is outrageous and dangerous   Indeed  you acknowledged the importance of Congress in our Iraq policy at a hearing before the House Armed Services Committee in March  when you stated  I believe that the debate here on the Hill and the issues that have been raised have been helpful in bringing pressure to bear on the Maliki government and on the Iraqis in knowing that there is a very real limit to American patience in this entire enterprise    Redeploying out of Iraq will be difficult and requires careful planning   I continue to call on the Bush Administration to immediately provide a redeployment strategy that will keep our brave men and women safe as they leave Iraq  instead of adhering to a political strategy to attack those who rightfully question their competence and preparedness after years of mistakes and misjudgments      Other members of this Administration have not engaged in political attacks when the prospect of withdrawal planning has been raised   At the June 7 Armed Services Committee confirmation hearing on Lieutenant General Douglas Lute  I asked General Lute what level of planning has taken place and whether the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs have been briefed about the level of planning   I also asked General Lute to determine what kind of timeline would exist if a decision for either military or political reasons were taken to begin withdrawal and if he considered this kind of planning to be part of his responsibilities    General Lute replied  Thank you Senator   I do think such an adaptation  if the conditions on the ground call for it  will be part of this position    I renew my request for a briefing  classified if necessary  on current plans for the future withdrawal of U S  forces from Iraq or an explanation for the decision not to engage in such planning   I also renew my concern that our troops will be placed in unnecessary danger if the Bush Administration fails to plan for the withdrawal of U S  Forces   Finally  I request that you describe whether Under Secretary Edelmans letter accurately characterizes your views as Secretary of Defense     I would appreciate the courtesy of a prompt response directly from you   Thank you for your consideration     Sincerely yours    Hillary Rodham Clinton    CC  General Peter Pace  USMC  Chairman  Joint Chiefs of Staff   Admiral Michael Mullen  USN  Chief of Naval Operations   Lieutenant General Douglas E  Lute  USA  Assistant to the President and  Deputy National Security Advisor for Iraq and Afghanistan     Read more
