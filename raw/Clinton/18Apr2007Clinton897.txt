April 18  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Supreme Court s Gonzales v  Carhart Decision                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC    This decision marks a dramatic departure from four decades of Supreme Court rulings that upheld a woman s right to choose and recognized the importance of women s health   Today s decision blatantly defies the Court s recent decision in 2000 striking down a state partial birth abortion law because of its failure to provide an exception for the health of the mother   As the Supreme Court recognized in Roe v  Wade in 1973  this issue is complex and highly personal  the rights and lives of women must be taken into account   It is precisely this erosion of our constitutional rights that I warned against when I opposed the nominations of Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito
