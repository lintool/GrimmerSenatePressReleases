                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Senators Graham   Clinton Pledge to Continue Pushing for Better Benefits for Members of the National Guard and Reserves                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC   Today  the program that U S  Senators Lindsey Graham  SC  and Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  helped create to expand access to health care benefits for reservists goes into effect   In October 2004  the Senators worked to pass a provision in the FY 2005 Ronald Reagan Defense Authorization Bill enabling reservists meeting eligibility requirements to enroll in TRICARE  the military health care system   The Senators hailed the expansion of the program today  but emphasized that there is still more work to be done to provide members of the National Guard and Reserves with the health care benefits they deserve           The eligibility requirements allow Guardsmen and Reservists who serve on active duty under federal orders for 90 consecutive days or more to be eligible for one year of TRICARE coverage  For every additional 90 days of service they will be eligible for an additional year of health care coverage           The Department of Defense  DOD  pays approximately 72 percent and the reservist is responsible for the remaining 28 percent   The costs will be  75 per month for the member only plan or  233 per month for member and family               This is another step forward in our effort to ensure that every member of the Selected Reserve and their families have year round access to military health care     said Graham  the only U S  Senator currently serving in a Guard or Reserve unit     Providing health care will be a tremendous benefit  as almost one fifth of Guardsmen and Reservists do not have health care in the private sector                Today marks an important stride forward in expanding eligibility for TRICARE military health benefits to our Guard members and Reservists and their families     said Clinton     But more work needs to be done to ensure that our Guard and Reserve have access to the health care benefits they need and deserve               Under the old rules  members of the Reserve Component and their families were eligible for TRICARE only while on active duty               Guardsmen and Reservists are the only part time federal employees who are currently ineligible for federal government full time health care benefits     said Graham     It  s my goal  in a bipartisan manner  to alleviate this inequity   This program we helped push into law last year takes another step toward that goal               When Senator Graham and I visited our troops in Iraq we saw first hand that the role of our Guard and Reserve has changed   They are taking on significant responsibility  playing critically important roles both overseas and in homeland security     said Clinton     We need to give them the support they need to be successful and the program being launched today helps move us in that direction              In February  Graham and Clinton introduced legislation  S 337  The Guard and Reserve Readiness Retention Act of 2005  to further expand healthcare benefits for members of the National Guard and Reserves by allowing them to enroll in TRICARE for a monthly premium regardless of their activation status           In addition  the legislation provides for a decrease in retirement age based on years of service   Under current law  the retirement age is 60   Under the proposal  if an individual serves for 22 years  they are eligible for retirement at 59   An individual entering military service at 18 and serving for 34 years could begin receiving his or her retirement benefits at 53             We  re going to continue pushing for a better benefit package for our citizen soldiers     said Graham     The National Guard and Reserves have been called upon more often to help protect this country and defend American interests   They are playing a vital role in Operation Iraqi Freedom and are an integral part of the war on terrorism   They need to be rewarded and justly compensated for their service to our nation   Our proposal will also help in our recruiting and retention efforts                Under our bill  if you are a member of the National Guard or Reserves  you and your family have access to health care     said Clinton    We believe this is the right thing to do for our Guard and Reserves and a smart thing to do as we rely on the reserve component to make up a significant part of our military operations          Click here to
