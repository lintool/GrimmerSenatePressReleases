Clinton  a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee  today kicked off a week of continued focus on issues affecting our men and women in uniform  Visiting Veterans Affairs  VA  Medical Centers in Syracuse and Canandaigua  NY  and then visit Ft  Drum  home of the Army s 10th Mountain Division  the Senator highlighted the need to provide support to our troops and their families       Senator Clinton in Syracuse  NY     Senator Clinton recently introduced a package of legislation aimed at helping U S  troops and their families to transition after deployment in Iraq and Afghanistan  including             the Heroes at Home Act of 2007 to get them the help they need by improving the detection  assessment and treatment of traumatic brain injury and expanding support systems for members and former members of the Armed Services with traumatic brain injury and their families  and           the Restoring Disability Benefits for Injured and Wounded Warriors Act of 2007 and the Protecting Military Family Financial Benefits Act of 2007 to help ensure that wounded soldiers receive the disability benefits they need and deserve and to further protect military family financial benefits           When our brave men and women go to war  they should expect to be supported before they leave and be treated as heroes when they return  with the promise of adequate assistance and healthcare  That is the promise our country must keep to the men and women who enlist  who fight  and who return home often bearing the visible and invisible scars of sacrifice  This should be a time when we do more for our troops and their families  not less   Senator Clinton said          Senator Clinton in Canandaigua  NY   These bills will help our soldiers and their families if they suffer or are wounded  they will help to ensure that wounded soldiers receive the disability benefits they need and deserve and they will help protect military family financial benefits if a loved one is deployed   Senator Clinton said   After visiting today with our brave troops and seeing firsthand what they are coping with  I am even more convinced that we must show them   not just tell them   that we are grateful for their service to our country       Senator Clinton in Canandaigua  NY     On Thursday  in Washington  DC  Senator Clinton will also attend a Joint Hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate Veterans  Affairs Committee to receive testimony on the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs disability rating systems and the transition of service members from the Department of Defense to the Department of Veterans Affairs          Senator Clinton s legislative package includes       The Heroes At Home Act of 2007     Senator Clinton in Washington  DC  Senator Clinton s legislation will build on the groundbreaking  Heroes at Home  initiative she authored and secured in law last year aimed at helping U S  troops and their families to transition after deployment in Iraq and Afghanistan and get the help they need with readjustment to work and coping with post traumatic stress disorder and TBI       Senator Clinton in Washington  DC     Senator Clinton s new initiative will expand Heroes at Home by             Improving the screening process for our troops before deployment to improve TBI diagnoses after deployment  Traumatic brain injury  which affects approximately one out of every 10 returning servicemembers  has been identified as the  signature wound  affecting soldiers deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan  Multiple deployments and prevalent use of IEDs have put servicemembers at increased risk of sustaining more than one mild or moderate TBI  However  mild and moderate TBI may go undetected  especially if a servicemember has sustained more obvious injuries  It also can be difficult to distinguish mild TBI from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder since both conditions have common symptoms  such as irritability  anxiety and depression  Senator Clinton s bill will improve detection of mild and moderate TBI by implementing an objective  computer based assessment protocol to measure cognitive functioning both prior to and after deployment  Senator Clinton s bill will require that the same assessment tool be used across all branches of the Armed Services and for every member of the Armed Forces who will be deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan             Helping families struggling to take care of a loved one with training and certification for dealing with brain injuries and psychological injuries  Family members of returning soldiers with TBI are often ill equipped to handle the demands of caring for their loved one  which in some bases can become a full time responsibility  Senator Clinton s bill will establish a Traumatic Brain Injury Family Caregiver Personal Care Attendant Training and Certification Program  which would train and certify family caregivers of TBI patients as personal care attendants  enabling them to provide quality care at home and at the same time qualify for compensation from the VA             Expanding Access to Needed Care  Servicemembers and veterans continue to face problems in accessing needed medical and mental health care  especially veterans or Guard and Reserve members who live in rural areas  Senator Clinton s bill will help increase the reach of needed care for TBI by expanding use of telehealth and telemental health services  Senator Clinton s bill will create a demonstration project  administered jointly by the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs that would use telehealth technology to assess TBI and related mental health conditions and facilitate rehabilitation and dissemination of educational material on techniques  strategies and skills for servicemembers with TBI           The Heroes at Home Act of 2007 is endorsed by the Wounded Warrior Project  National Military Families Association  Military Officers Association of America  American Academy of Neurology and Brain Injury Association of America        Restoring Disability Benefits for Injured and Wounded Warriors Act of 2007     Senator Clinton in Syracuse  NY  Following up on complaints she heard from New York soldiers at Walter Reed about widespread problems with disability claims  Senator Clinton today introduced legislation that will restore disability benefits for wounded and injured members of the Armed Forces  The act will direct reviews of disability claims  traumatic injury claims and the Physical Evaluation Board process  and re open cases that warrant an increased disability benefit rating or traumatic injury payment  In addition  the bill will increase the availability of legal counsel for members appealing their disability cases  and direct the GAO to investigate efforts currently being made by the Department of Defense to address deficiencies in the Disability Evaluation Systems  the adequacy of the Department of Veterans Affairs Disability Schedule for Ratings as it relates to the nature of wounds our warriors suffer in combat today  and to report on the standards and procedures of Physical Evaluation Boards       Senator Clinton in Syracuse  NY  Protecting Military Family Financial Benefits Act of 2007      Senator Clinton also introduced legislation that will protect financial benefits for military family members by closing gaps in coverage for Death Gratuity and Survivor Benefits beneficiaries and improve pre deployment counseling and services for all members of the Armed Forces  Everyday single parents deploy to distant battlefields and leave their minor children in the care of a financially ill prepared guardian or caretaker  Unfortunately  when tragedy strikes and a military servicemember makes the ultimate sacrifice  minor dependent children and families are excluded from receiving benefits and entitlements  In too many cases  pre deployment systems and processes designed to protect military family financial benefits are under resourced or not available and create unnecessary burden for survivors  Senator Clinton s bill will require each military service to provide adequate pre deployment counseling and services to every deploying member of the Armed Forces to ensure that families and dependents receive survivor benefits and entitlements           These bills are supported by the Wounded Warrior Project  National Military Families Association  Military Officers Association of America  American Legion and the Gold Star Mothers           As New York s first Senator to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee  Senator Clinton has made it one of her top priorities to ensure that our brave men and women in uniform have the healthcare and support they need  She has pressed for an independent investigation of the conditions at Walter Reed and called for a new GI Bill of Rights to once again honor the service and invest in the future of our men and women in uniform  She authored legislation signed into law last year that required an audit of widespread pay issues wounded soldiers are facing  recently released by the Army showing continuing problems  Senator Clinton has fought to ensure servicemembers have the body armor they need  She has also secured in law access to TRICARE military health benefits for all drilling members of the National Guard and Reserves and their families                      SENATOR CLINTON   STANDING UP FOR SERVICEMEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES     Senator Clinton in Syracuse  NY  As New York s first Senator to serve on the Senate

at Home Act of 2007  in April to improve the detection  assessment and treatment of TBI and expand support systems for members and former members of the Armed Services with TBI and their families

families  Senator Clinton worked to secure in law access to military health care  TRICARE  for all members of the Guard and Reserve and their families                 Anticipating the lack of

armor being provided to our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and requested a Government Accountability Office investigation to determine how the Pentagon procures body armor for our troops
