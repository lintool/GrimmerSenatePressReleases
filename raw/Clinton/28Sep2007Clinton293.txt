September 28  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Passage of the Children s Health Insurance Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC  I am proud that Congress has put partisanship aside and come together to do the right thing for our children and families  The president now has the choice  will he help nearly four million uninsured children gain access to the health care they desperately need or will he turn his back on them  I hope the president makes the right choice   I was proud to help create the Childrens Health Insurance Program  CHIP  during the Clinton Administration  which today provides health insurance for six million children  In New York alone  almost 400 000 children benefit from CHIP every month  By enacting this bill into law  3 8 million uninsured children will gain coverage  including an additional 72 000 children in New York who will have access to health care  The legislation will also help reach many of the almost 300 000 children in New York who live in families that are already eligible but not yet enrolled    I am also proud that this bill includes the Support for Injured Servicemembers Act of 2007  legislation that Senator Dodd and I introduced to provide up to six months of job protected leave for spouses  children  parents or next of kin of service members who suffer from a combat related injury or illness  Currently  these spouses  parents and children can receive only twelve weeks of leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act  All too often  this is just not enough time  as injured service members struggle to grapple with traumatic brain injuries  severe physical wounds  and other problems upon returning home from Iraq  Afghanistan  and elsewhere  Expanding leave to six months is a step we can take immediately that will make a real difference in the lives of these wounded warriors and their families and I hope the President will stand with them by signing this bill into law    I am disappointed  however  that the bill approved fails to include the Legal Immigrant Childrens Health Improvement Act  which I introduced with Senator Snowe and have been working on for a number of years  This bipartisan bill would give states the flexibility to provide the same Medicaid and CHIP coverage to low income legal immigrant children and pregnant women as they do to U S  citizens  The current restrictions prevent thousands of immigrant children and pregnant women who are here legally and are following the rules from receiving preventive health services and treatment for minor illnesses before they become serious  This hurts children and families and we should put a stop to it      Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning children s health insurance
