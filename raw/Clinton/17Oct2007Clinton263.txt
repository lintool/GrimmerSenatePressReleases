

at the American Ballet Theatre  Abyssinian Development Corporation  Gay Mens Health Crisis  Inc   John Jay College  Mother Cabrini High School  and Girls Incorporated  The bill will now proceed to a Conference Committee where the House and Senate will resolve the differences between their versions  Following conference  the bill will again be sent to the House and Senate for final approval  after which it will be sent to the President for his signature    This vital funding will energize after school and youth enrichment programs  drug awareness campaigns and emergency response studies  These programs will allow many of the neediest and most vulnerable New Yorkers to live happier  safer lives  said Senator Schumer     This funding will help provide opportunities for young New Yorkers to broaden their lives and reach their full potential  I am also very pleased that we could secure these funds for the Regenhard Center  Our first responders put their lives on the line for us every day  and we must provide them the tools they need to best do their jobs  An integrated and comprehensive analysis of emergency response will better ensure that we are prepared in the event of another disaster  said Senator Clinton   The Gay Mens Health Clinic is providing a critical service in working to halt the devastation that methamphetamine brings to our community   With HIV AIDS rates among meth users more than twice as high as the general public  these funds are essential in helping the Gay Mens Health Clinic continue the fight against HIV AIDS through treatment and prevention      200 000 of federal funds will go to the American Ballet Theatres Make a Ballet On Tour Program for At Risk Youth   The funds will be used to expand and implement the Make a Ballet On Tour Program  based on the highly successful Make a Ballet Program in New York  to schools in participating pilot cities  Chicago  Miami  Los Angeles  and Washington  D C    The Abyssinian Development Corporations Youth Program will receive  500 000 of federal funds to support and expand the youth and young adult after school and summer programs offered as a part of the Abyssinian Development Corporations Neighborhood Project   The funds will be used to serve an additional 200 children in the Central Harlem area     350 000 of federal funds will go to the Gay Mens Health Crisis  Inc s Combating the Use of Crystal Methamphetamine Nationally Program to launch a multi tiered anti crystal methamphetamine campaign to help fight the increasing rate of HIV transmission  The use of crystal methamphetamine has reached epidemic proportions  contributing to a dramatic influx in the number of new HIV cases among certain populations of gay men   The campaign will focus on reducing the use of crystal methamphetamine  thereby reducing its impact on the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections       The Regenhard Center for Emergency Response Studies at John Jay College will receive  200 000 of federal funds to buy equipment  technology and curriculum development materials to study emergency response  Named after the FDNY firefighter Christian Regenhard who was killed on September 11th  2001  the Center will be a research entity and information clearinghouse for the study of emergency responses to large scale disasters   While other academic institutions study disasters or emergency management  there is no central focus on the critical role of responders and the emergency response itself  especially in the urban environment   John Jay College and the Regenhard Center will fill that void  working collaboratively with other institutions to provide insight and expertise in the disaster emergency studies field      The Pupils On the Way to Excellent Results Project at Mother Cabrini High School will receive  200 000 of federal funds to enable MCHS to expand its after school program for at risk youth   Funding will be used to expand internships
