September 19  2005 Clinton and Schumer Call on President Bush to Reverse Suspension of Davis Bacon Act in Wake of Hurricane Katrina                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Senators Underscore Importance of Fair Pay for Wor                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Washington  DC    Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles Schumer today called on President Bush to reverse his short sighted decision to suspend the Davis Bacon Act in the Hurricane ravaged areas of Alabama  Louisiana  Mississippi and Florida   The law requires that employers pay the local prevailing wage to construction workers on federally financed projects            It is critical that those affected by Hurricane Katrina receive fair wages as they struggle to get back on their feet and rebuild their lives     said Senator Clinton     We have a moral obligation to do everything we can to help put these families on the road to recovery   Instead  the President is putting a road block in their path              The President  s decision will only hurt the hard working men and women affected by this tragedy   We need to be taking every step possible to ensure that we are putting people back into the workforce with wages that will allow them to support themselves and their families as they try to pick up the pieces from this devastating storm     Schumer said    This is a step in the wrong direction           In a letter to President Bush  the Senators noted that it would have been unthinkable to suspend the Davis Bacon Act in the wake of September 11 as workers stayed around the clock  day after day  to help with the recovery and clean up effort   The Senators underscored that this situation is no different and the workers in the Gulf deserve no less respect          The failed response to the disaster in the Gulf Region plainly revealed that the people in the affected areas need our support   Last Thursday in your address to the nation you pledged that   the government of this nation will do its part     Undermining one of America  s core worker protection laws in the midst of such a crisis undermines our nation  s commitment to helping the workers of the affected region   We urge you in the strongest possible terms to reverse this ill advised and harmful decision     the Senators wrote        The text of their letter to President Bush follows          The Honorable George W  Bush  President of the United States  Washington  D C   20500    Dear Mr  President      We urge you to immediately reverse your decision to suspend the Davis Bacon Act in the affected areas of Alabama  Louisiana  Mississippi  and Florida because of the disastrous consequences this act will have on the local economy and the economic prospects for workers from the disaster zone and their families          As you know  the protections of Davis Bacon require federal contractors to pay mechanical and construction workers a prevailing wage for their work in their locality   In the Gulf region  this often amounts to as little as  9 per hour   The individuals who lost their homes and jobs as a result of the hurricane need and deserve every chance at a secure future   Surely  you do not think  9 per hour is too high a wage to pay to people who have lost everything         The Davis Bacon protections ensure that workers get fair pay for a hard day s work    Prevailing wages ensure that workers can afford the rising price of gas as well as the increasing costs of health care  food  tuition  and other essentials        After September 11th  as we all remember so well  the workers stayed around the clock day after day to help with the recovery and cleanup effort   They did it out of grief and love for their hometown and fellow workers   In New Orleans and throughout the affected region  we have seen an equally passionate commitment among the workers to rebuilding their community  Yet  suspending Davis Bacon was unthinkable in the wake of September 11th   At the heart of the government  s response  it would have been a grievous affront to the people who had already suffered a severe blow   This situation is no different and the workers in the Gulf deserve no less respect           The failed response to the disaster in the Gulf Region plainly revealed that the people in the affected areas need our support   Last Thursday in your address to the nation you pledged that   the government of this nation will do its part     Undermining one of America  s core worker protection laws in the midst of such a crisis undermines our nation  s commitment to helping the workers of the affected region   We urge you in the strongest possible terms to reverse this ill advised and harmful decision        Sincerely          Charles E  Schumer  Hillary Rodham Clinton
