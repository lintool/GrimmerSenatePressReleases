Fiscal Year 2008 Department of Defense Appropriations bill includes   Binghamton University  Center for Advanced Microelectronics Manufacturing  CAMM     2 Million   Funding will be used to continue development of new  flexible and low cost electronics based on roll to roll  R2R  manufacturing technologies to enhance U S  military superiority  while strengthening our nations role as a global technology leader  Advancements in the underlying materials and manufacturing technology for flexible  organic and printed electronics components and devices are critical for visionary applications related to the military and to national security   Extensive communications capability  enhanced power sources  extensive sensors deployment for threat detection and health monitoring  and active body armor and camouflage will prove important to the future warfighter  These developments are critical to make the future warrior more mobile  more lethal and more secure   Dresser Rand  Advanced Steam Turbine    4 Million   Funding will be used to develop a steam turbine that can be used on the existing Virginia Class and future submarines  which will meet or exceed the capability of the existing steam turbine   This advanced turbine is estimated to reduce the cost the Navy is paying today by as much as 40 percent  and through improved efficiencies will provide the Navy a turbine with more

the required systems will have the operational advantage of choosing the most efficient and economical routes of flight  as well as continued access to airspace that is now regularly used in DoD world wide operations   While operational access to airspace was important to address the military commitments of the 1990s  it has now reached a critical stage as the U S  faces new challenges   It is imperative that the U S  is capable of projecting airpower to any location via the most direct route   This is fundamental to having combat crews reach the target area with the most fuel and in the least fatigued condition possible   BAE Systems  On Board Vehicle Power Management    1 6 million   The Army has an operational requirement for more power on their up armored HMMWVs  Buffalos  Cougars and RG31 vehicles in Iraq and Afghanistan   With the addition of critical equipment for warfighter survivability  to include Improvised Explosive Device Defeat  there is an identified vehicle requirement for 400 Amp 28 Vdc electrical power at engine idle   Funding will enable the continued development and demonstration of technology that will generate this essential electrical power for the Armys tactical wheeled vehicles   Schweizer Aircraft Corp   MQ 8B Fire Scout    37 687 million  Presidents Budget    The Fire Scout VTUAV  Vertical Takeoff and Landing Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle  System is being developed for the U S Navy and Army   Its primary role is to provide situational awareness and precision targeting for Navy forces at sea and Army forces on land   Its long endurance  performance  sophisticated payloads  ability to take off and land vertically  and an autonomous operational capability make Fire Scout capable of providing long range surveillance and
