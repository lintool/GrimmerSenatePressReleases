March 15  2007 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton s Remarks on Subprime Lending to the National Community Reinvestment Coalition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Thank you so much   And I could not have had a better economic development partner in Upstate New York than Lee Beaulac and Rural Opportunities  Inc   We ve had a lot of fun   It has been challenging and sometimes frustrating to bring people together to talk about what we were going to do to reinvest in communities and provide economic opportunities and housing and healthcare  microcredit and just a whole a range of issues that we have worked on together for the last six years   But Lee does know how the public sector and the private sector both work and he combines that knowledge with a real passion to improve the lives of people   So I want to thank you in front of all of your peers and your colleagues  someone who I am very grateful to work with and I am so pleased that he could introduce me              I also want to thank John Taylor because the fact that NCRC is now celebrating 30 years of CRA is a big accomplishment   There were lots of times when we were checking for a pulse   Was CRA still beating   Was it going to be there as a tool that we could use for reinvestment   And thanks to all of you  it is   And we re going to strengthen it   We re going to begin to strengthen it in the Democratic Congress   And it s certainly one of my priorities because I believe in community development investment funds   I believe in empowerment zones   I believe in the tools that we know work in communities   And I was proud during the Clinton Administration to work with some of you and to visit some of the projects like the one that Lee was talking about in Newburgh   So there s a lot of work that needs to go on and we have a lot of good examples of what will make it possible for us to bring people into the mainstream economically and provide economic opportunity across all sectors of our economy and every region of our country             And I want to thank Irvin Henderson  the chairman of the board of NCRC and all of the board members because obviously they are committed to doing what does work   And to all the New Yorkers who are here today  thank you for being partners in what we have done together over the last six years           NCRC stands firmly behind a really simple idea that when Americans are given the tools for success  Americans succeed   You know  when the American government is on our side  we all do better together   And it is important that we renew that mission every so often because we face new challenges           You know  when my husband started running for president back in 1992  which wasn t exactly the dark ages  some might think it was  but I know it wasn t   It was not that long ago  There wasn t really an Internet   There was an Internet that existed for scientists to communicate  but there weren t hundreds of millions of websites   We have changed so much   And we have to keep asking ourselves  what do we do to bring opportunity to everyone            And Lee mentioned one of my projects up in the North Country of New York  And that was to put small  rural businesses on EBay   Because I said to myself  you know  there s not much of a market up here   These folks are working really  really hard and they re producing high quality products but they don t have many people to sell them to   So what we did was work with EBay to put these businesses on the Internet  help them with their websites  help them get some technical assistance so when the orders started coming in  they would know how to meet them             Lee mentioned one of the businesses we put on  which was a soap maker   Really high quality soap  she made  in a very painstaking process that was pure and really traditional   Somebody working for Oprah came across one of her soaps and one day after she got on EBay  she gets an order for  40 000 worth of soap   She had to go out and get every person she knew in her community to come in and help her make soap   So that was a good problem to have   And that s the kind of challenges that we want to overcome by being innovative and creative together            Well  obviously I believe in the basic bargain that I was raised with   You know  if you work hard  you play by the rules  you ought to be able to get ahead   And that s what I was raised with and I think that is at the heart of the American Dream            Well unfortunately  we still have too much of America that is held back by a lack of capital  investment and opportunity   Middle class families and families struggling to reach and stay in the middle class are really being squeezed from all sides            You know Americans are struggling to pay for college costs and energy costs and healthcare costs  because after all  premiums have gone up 90 percent since 2000   And I m concerned that we re not facing the problems that we have  We re not meeting our challenges the way previous generations of Americans did             We have 47 million people without health insurance  When you have 300 million people dependent on foreign oil  when you have more than 90 000 of our fellow citizens still living in trailers along the Gulf coast  it is time for a change and it is time for  inaudible           I want to focus on one aspect of the American Dream  of that basic bargain  because I am worried about homeownership   And as we have seen in recent days  the basic bargain that may be breaking down is homeownership            There has been a lot of attention recently on the volatility in the subprime housing market  But the subprime fallout takes a toll on families as well   These are not just statistics  these are flesh and blood people who are so proud of that first home  who felt like they finally had a real foothold in the American middle class that they were going to have their children in a safer environment            Now we know that there were more bankruptcies in America last year than college graduates   And half of those bankruptcies were due to an illness and people unable to pay their medical costs            So a lot of these new homeowners are one illness away from foreclosure  They re one job loss away  They re one  let s cut your hours away   They are hanging on  Because despite what you hear from the happy talkers on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue and for some of those folks they put on TV  wages have been stagnant  haven t they            So you ve got CEO pay up  You ve got corporate profits up  You ve got productivity up  which means that we re all working harder than ever before   But the folks who are doing the work are not getting rewarded   And a lot of those folks during the 90s  when we created 22 million new jobs and lifted more people out of poverty than at any time in our history  they felt that we and our country were on the right track  didn t they   And they thought the sky was the limit   They were going to send that child to college  They were going to get that home   Well  now we are concerned  and NCRC has been sounding the alarm to try to wake us up for the last several years   Well  I sure hope we re awake now          You can t be surprised  can you   Because the alarm bell about the subprime home market has largely gone unnoticed by this Administration because they keep arguing we have to give trillions of dollars of tax cuts for the wealthy   They keep arguing that a  9 trillion national debt and an increasing trade deficit    the highest in history    are signs of increasing strength   Well  I have to say that I don t buy that   I think there are trouble signs below the horizon   Maybe they re not as obvious to some  but you keep sounding that alarm  Because I believe that we ve got to take action            According to most recent statistics  delinquent payments now affect more than 13 percent of subprime loans in our country   That s the highest level in four years   Now  many would attribute this rise to unsophisticated homebuyers  even irresponsible buyers  or the subprime market itself   But the foreclosure rate for all mortgages increased by more than 17 percent in the last quarter of 2006   That s the highest foreclosure rate in four decades           So when somebody tells you this subprime market thing is no big deal  or maybe  you know what  let the buyer beware  these folks signed on the dotted line  it s their responsibility  Ask them why the rate for all homeowners is so high   Because the economy is not supporting homeownership the way we need it to   And after all  in the absence of an alternative  the subprime market has opened the doors to millions of families and responsible lenders and the market are rightfully casting out some of the worst actors in the subprime industry   But the market will not address the millions of families trapped in unworkable mortgages  hounded by delinquency and facing the grim possibility of foreclosure            Now there will always be risk  and we cannot absolve it and should not absolve homebuyers of his or her responsibility   But we should make the rules clear and level the playing field            The subprime problems are now creating massive issues on Wall Street   It s a serious problem affecting our housing market and millions of hard working families            So what are some of the things we need to do   We need to expand the role of the FHA to issue more mortgages at better rates to these homeowners   We need to give consumers more counseling and information  prevent families from being trapped in high interest loans with pre payment penalties and in some cases  allow more breathing room from foreclosure   This market is clearly broken and if we don t fix it  it could threaten our entire housing market  which in turn would threaten our entire economy            So this is a serious issue and I m so pleased to be in front of a serious group to just spend a few minutes talking with you about it            You know  often the plight of these families are lost   We just don t focus on who they are  but we all know them   I bet if we had the people who served lunch today come in and asked them to raise their hands  you d see folks who bought their first home  wouldn t you   Probably some in this crowd know people personally who have   And we know that very often people are paying in rent what they should be paying in mortgage to actually own something  but they don t have anyone to help them cross that bridge            What we have to do is try to figure out how to help people who because of their credit history or a lack of savings because they re living paycheck to paycheck or for other reasons are diverted into the higher rates of the subprime market   Well that s why I think the Federal Housing Administration must be made to work better             Because after all the FHA remains an industry leader in serving minority  first time  and low income home buyers   And it continues to help people who don t qualify for prime mortgages to avoid risky and in some cases predatory mortgage products   And  very importantly the rate of minority lending through FHA has grown to more than one in three after many years when it didn t look like that was very welcome  right          So unfortunately the FHA s impact on the marketplace has declined  because of inefficiencies and personnel shortages  they cannot keep up with demands at FHA   In the 1990 s  FHA backed loans represented about 12 percent of the market   Today  it s closer to three percent            This is another one of these government programs that this administration wants to starve and by doing so cut off the dream of homeownership   Now  I will soon be reintroducing my 21st Century Housing Act  which will take steps to modernize the agency by allowing the FHA to reinvest a portion of its revenues in new employees and information technology  to develop new mortgages to meet market demand and to position the FHA to work more efficiently with lenders and to serve more borrowers            I also want to raise the FHA mortgage limits for high cost of living areas so it can reach home buyers in more expensive markets   Many people in New York cannot afford a home within two hours of where they work   If the FHA limit were higher  they could afford a home and we should make that happen            But what if that family that we re trying to get into their home decides they will seek out a subprime loan   Well  we have to put ourselves in the shoes of a parent signing a mortgage product unaware of a complicated  escalating payment formula that has been worked out on some computer that has balloon payments and pre payment penalties  which includes the cost of taxes and insurance  and other added on costs that the owner doesn t really understand and nobody takes the time to explain them   Clear and easy to understand disclosure  plain talk meant to inform  not to confuse must be the starting point   Buyer beware is just not enough           So  I also propose a stop to pre payment penalties designed to trap borrowers when payments skyrocket   These penalties apply to 70 percent of sub prime mortgages but less than five percent of prime mortgages            Now  we can imagine a family stuck in this subprime catch 22   A family tries to be responsible and pay down on their principal and even make payments ahead of time   But  in the fine print they learn that unlike everything else in their world  if they pay things off and get ahead  there s going to be penalties imposed on them   This is totally perverse   So they re stuck waiting for the rate to go up instead of being given the opportunity to protect themselves   And then they may very well find themselves on the brink of foreclosure            I m also calling for independent counseling to be made available  so when buyers like this family sign the dotted line they understand what they are signing   And as you know from your own experience at NCRC more than one third of subprime borrowers could qualify for lower rate prime mortgages  but many low income and minority borrowers are simply unaware of there options           Finally  we also know that sometimes because of a sudden catastrophic illness or an accident that disables or injures the prime bread winner  or other circumstances  very responsible families have trouble making their payments   Now unfortunately  homeowners in distress often simply miss payment after payment and eventually lose their homes   A better alternative would be to create incentives for lenders to identify troubled mortgages and to work out solutions before foreclosure happens   Lenders might for example  give borrowers a period of a foreclosure time out  during which borrowers will have the opportunity to put their financial houses in order and to work out a payment plan   This proposal can build on the great efforts that NCRC is already leading with your Consumer Rescue Fund Initiative   And I want to applaud you for this because this is wonderful agenda to restore the homeownership market and your network of community groups and responsible lenders and state and local governments should strengthen our ability to respond to this crisis            But  you know  really when it comes to homeownership we should get back to that basic bargain   If you play by the rules  you can count on the rules being fair  open  and honest   And responsible lenders and community organizations need to be encouraged to really live up to their end of the bargain            I want to see more opportunities for lenders to go into communities that have not always been well served   And I know it can be done   Several years ago  I challenged New York s credit unions to reach a goal of  100 million in responsible home loans to first time buyers in under served areas   These were areas where usually the only alternative would have been a sub prime or risky mortgage   The result  well  a year later the credit unions all came back to my office to report that they have exceeded their goal   They announced  150 million in loans and they are still  inaudible             I think it s also important that we look for ways for the government to incentivize these changes and to provide some kind of safety net if the worst happens and escalating foreclosures begin to mount            You know  it s true that I travel around the country a lot now and speak in big cities and very small towns just as I did throughout my years in the Senate in New York   And there are a lot of people who are feeling less and less connected to one another   You know  it s ironic that in this age of virtual reality where people are on the Internet and bending over working their text messages and blackberries that there is a sense that perhaps we are not as secure as we once were   You know  people are working more  but their jobs are less secure   The whole family has cell phones  but finds it nearly impossible to sit down around the dinner table together   Our nation is growing more interdependent in the global economy  but increasingly feels divided here at home            Well  I believe we can pursue policies together that lift us all up and homeownership is one piece of that puzzle   And that is why it s so important that what you re doing continues            And the Community Reinvestment Act was a wise decision thirty years ago by Congress and President Carter   And it has made a tremendous difference   Bank lending to minorities and lower and moderate income borrowers has gone up 20 percent since then   But we still have a lot to do            I ve done a lot of work in microcredit over the years going back to Arkansas when I worked with my husband and Dr  Muhammad Yunus who just won the Noble Peace Prize for the Grameen Bank to bring Grameen Bank techniques to Arkansas   And I ve been in many different settings with borrowers and lenders who are doing microcredit   I ll never forget a woman in Denver who said to me   more dreams die in the parking lots of banks than anywhere else    We need to figure out how we re going to open up the commercial lending sector and continue to provide more alternatives as well           And when I go out and speak with my constituents  they re not asking for a handout   They re just asking once again to be part of this great American Dream  this adventure that we are all on together   They just want the tools to help them realize their own ambitions            Now  when I created an organization called New Jobs for New York  to try and bring more capital from New York City upstate  I went around and met with a lot of the entrepreneurs who were trying to break through and look for a chance to get the capital they needed   And time and time again there was just no place for them to go            Well  it would be in America s interest to have a big national capital fund that would make bets again on smart people who are willing to work hard   I want to do that in the strategic energy area   You know  I meet people all over the country who have good ideas about alternative energy  but they re not getting the funding they need to translate that into reality   And when it comes to the Renewal Communities which the Clinton administration started back in 2000  well  I see the results of those investments in tourism along the Erie Canal  which had basically been just left to wither   I see those investments in the local wine industry in New York   And I think if we pursue a comprehensive agenda  urban and rural  leaving nobody out  then I think we re going to have the consensus we need in the country to start solving problems again   Because that s what I believe in           I believe that if we put our heads together and we start looking at the facts and the evidence  and put the ideology on the back shelf somewhere  because I ve never seen any ideology that helps you solve a problem  you ve got to get together and see what the real facts are  And we know a lot about what works  we ve just been stymied a little bit in the last six years   But we re going to get rid of those roadblocks  and we re going to roll up our sleeves and we re going to starting acting liking Americans again  We re going to start solving our problems together          We brought electricity to rural communities  we brought interstate highway systems  we re going to bring broadband deployment so that every community can be connected up to the global economy  We re going to have a new housing project program that is going to invest in local communities  We re going to have universal healthcare coverage and we re going to use energy to create new jobs   We can do this            Thank you all
