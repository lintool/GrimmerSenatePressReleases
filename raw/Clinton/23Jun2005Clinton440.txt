June 23  2005 Senators Clinton  Lautenberg and Others Fight to Preserve Funding for States with High HIV AIDS Populations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC    Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  and Frank Lautenberg  NJ  today called on the Government Accountability Office  GAO  to recognize the importance of care and treatment funding provided to cities with high incidence of HIV and AIDS under Title I of the Ryan White CARE Act  Joining in the fight to protect services for Americans living with HIV are Senators Charles Schumer  NY   Dianne Feinstein  CA  and Barbara Boxer  CA  who also signed the letter        The Ryan White CARE Act was first enacted in 1990 to provide care and treatment to Americans living with AIDS  The two biggest funding streams in the CARE Act are Titles I and II  Title I money is for cities with high rates of AIDS cases  known as eligible metropolitan areas  EMAs   and Title II money is for states with the bulk of the money going to AIDS Drug Assistance Programs  ADAPs   In addition to Title II state funding  New York receives Title I funding for its three eligible metropolitan areas in New York City  Nassau Suffolk counties  and Dutchess County        At a hearing Thursday in the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee s subcommittee on Federal Financial Management  the GAO presented preliminary findings on variations in CARE Act funding across the United States  States that receive funding for EMAs under Title I of the CARE Act are in danger of losing those resources because of the perception they are  double dipping   In its preliminary analysis  the GAO failed to account for the scope of services provided  the cost of living in various areas  and the differences between community   driven services provided by cities and the state level services provided under Title II         Changing such an allocation so that states receive funding only for cases located outside of EMAs would devastate the current AIDS service infrastructure  and result in delays or denials of care for the vast majority of people living with AIDS   the Senators wrote in their letter        Senator Clinton has long been a champion of ensuring adequate care and treatment of people who suffer from HIV AIDS  Earlier this year  the Senator joined Senator Gordon Smith in introducing the Early Treatment for HIV Act  This legislation redresses a fundamental flaw in the current Medicaid system that provides access to care only after HIV positive individuals have been diagnosed with AIDS  It would also give states the option of providing a full spectrum of preventive health care and treatment to low income individuals as soon as they are diagnosed with HIV  before they become sick         See attached letter        June 23  2005       The Honorable David M  Walker  Comptroller General of the United States  United States Government Accountability Office  441 G Street  N W   Washington  D C  20548       Dear Mr  Walker        As Senators representing states with high HIV AIDS caseloads and populations served by Title I Eligible Metropolitan Areas  EMAs   we are concerned with the preliminary data as presented in the testimony of the Government Accountability Office  GAO  before the Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management  Government Information  and International Security of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee on Thursday  June 23  We hope that in the final report  the GAO will take into account the necessity for stable  continued funding for the Title I EMA program  which provides community directed services  care and treatment to the vast majority of those living with HIV AIDS in the United States        We would like the GAO to address the following issues in its final report             The role of the grandfather clause in ensuring service provision  In the Ryan White CARE Act  a clause from the 1996 reauthorization states that EMAs designated prior to fiscal year 1996 will retain their status in subsequent fiscal years  Even if the criteria for designation as an EMA are not currently met by several grantees  over 70  of the Americans living with AIDS reside in areas served by Title I funding  Clearly  the burden of the domestic epidemic is still disproportionately based in cities that receive Title I funding  We would ask that  in the final report  the GAO include a discussion of the barriers to care and treatment in EMAs that would arise were the grandfather clause to be lifted  We would also ask that you consider the role the grandfather clause has played in protecting areas with high prevalence rates  as defined in the 1990 CARE Act  These areas would have been severely impacted by the 1996 reauthorization s elimination of the density factor from the Title I formula were it not for this grandfather clause              The inadequacies of using a per capita formula in funding analyses  There has been some concern that the amount allocated to various regions does not represent an equal distribution  on a per capita basis  of funding  What such an analysis fails to consider is both the level of services provided and the cost of living in various areas  Per capita funding formulations do not address the scope of services provided and the true extent of need in high cost of living areas like New York City  San Francisco  and other EMAs  In your report  we ask that the GAO consider both the range and actual cost of services provided in states and local communities prior to any analysis of funding distributions             The continued need for separate Title I and Title II funding streams  There is a perception that states with EMAs are somehow  double dipping  into Ryan White CARE Act funding  as such areas benefit from both Title I and Title II funding streams  However  such criticism fails to take into account differences between the local  community driven services provided in EMAs  and the state level services funded by Title II  This issue has already been addressed legislatively in the CARE Act  Formula allocations in Title II specifically place a greater weight on cases in non EMA areas  so that more funding will be directed to non EMA states  Changing such an allocation so that states receive funding only for cases located outside of EMAs would devastate the current AIDS service infrastructure  and result in delays or denials of care for the vast majority of people living with AIDS  We ask that when examining Title I vs  Title II funding issues  the GAO take into account the impact of reducing Title II funding upon service provision in these states with the greatest burden of cases         Thank you for your consideration of our request        Sincerely
