April 26  2007 Senator Clinton Calls on President Bush to Abandon Plan to Divide Immigrant Families                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on President Bush to reconsider immigration proposals reportedly under consideration by the Bush Administration that would dramatically scale back the existing family visa system   The proposal reportedly would place caps and waiting periods on the parents of U S  citizens applying for green cards  force all applicants who have been waiting in a family visa backlog to start again and pay a  500 fee  and create a point system that would deny visas to family members based on their education and skill levels   In a letter to President Bush  Senator Clinton emphasized that this immigration proposal would not only fail to help immigrant families  but would dramatically worsen the situation for families of hundreds of thousands of U S  citizens and lawful immigrants throughout the country            Separating these families is an affront to our nation s rich immigrant heritage and inconsistent with our principles which value the sanctity of families   I call on you to reconsider and abandon any provisions from your proposal that tear families apart and encourage you to pursue reforms that will unite the families of those who have played by the rules in pursuing the American dream   said Senator Clinton           Senator Clinton emphasized that we need to find a thoughtful and effective solution to our immigration crisis   Along with comprehensive reform of our immigration laws  we need to repair the broken parts of our immigration system that irrevocably damage families and force citizens and lawful immigrants to live apart from their spouses and children overseas   To help remedy this situation  Senator Clinton last year offered an amendment during consideration of immigration reform legislation that would have taken steps to protect the sanctity of families          The following is the text of Senator Clinton s letter to President Bush          The Honorable George W  Bush  The White House  Washington  D C  20500      Dear Mr  President       As you well know  our immigration system is in crisis  and we need to find a thoughtful and effective solution that combines a number of reforms   A comprehensive reform to our immigration laws must have  as essential ingredients  a strengthening of our borders  greater cross cooperation with our neighbors  strict but fair enforcement of our laws  federal assistance to our state and local governments  strict penalties for those who exploit undocumented workers  and a path to earned legal status for those who are here  working hard  paying taxes  respecting the law  and willing to meet a high bar            Along with these changes  it is imperative that we repair those broken portions of our immigration system that irrevocably damage families and force citizens and lawful immigrants to live apart from their spouses and children overseas   It is why last year I introduced an amendment during consideration of the immigration reform bill that would have taken steps to protect the sanctity of families   Our American values demand no less             Therefore  I was extremely disappointed to learn that according to recent reports  your Administration is entertaining an immigration reform proposal that not only fails to help immigrant families  but would dramatically worsen the situation for the families of hundreds of thousands of United States citizens and lawful immigrants throughout our country   According to reports  your proposal would dramatically scale back the existing family visa system   For example  the reports indicate that your proposal would eliminate several of the existing family preference categories  a change that would make it impossible for U S  citizens to sponsor many of their relatives for green cards   The proposal reportedly would also place caps and waiting periods on the parents of U S  citizens applying for green cards  force all applicants who have been waiting in a family visa backlog to start again and pay a  500 fee  and create a point system that would deny visas to family members based on their schooling and skill levels   While we need to attract skilled workers to this country  we should not do so at the expense of our families and communities          If these reports are accurate  your proposal would tear families apart and exact a lasting toll on the lives of citizens and lawful immigrants in this country   Your proposal would separate husbands from wives  and parents from children   Parents would be denied the opportunity to play an active role in raising their own children  and children would grow up not knowing one of their parents   These circumstances play out every day under the existing law  and your proposal would only make matters far worse             Separating these families is an affront to our nation s rich immigrant heritage and inconsistent with our principles which value the sanctity of families   I call on you to reconsider and abandon any provisions from your proposal that tear families apart and encourage you to pursue reforms that will unite the families of those who have played by the rules in pursuing the American dream          Sincerely yours       Hillary Rodham Clinton
