               WASHINGTON  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today joined Minority Leader Harry M  Reid and dozens of other US Senators in a letter to President Bush pressing him on his Administration  s policies regarding the war in Iraq            The text of the letter follows            October 5  2005         President George Bush   The White House   Washington  D C     Dear Mr  President          Our troops are engaged in a struggle in Iraq that could shape the future not only of that nation but the entire region   Despite the fact that our troops have performed heroically for more than 2      years  the situation there remains extremely violent and volatile   There are disturbing reports of increasing sectarian strife  which could lead to a full blown civil war   We are increasingly concerned that Iraq could become what it was not before the war  a haven for radical fundamentalist terrorists determined to attack America and American interests   It is clear our window of opportunity is closing and you need to immediately provide a strategy for success in order to prevent this outcome          These troubling conditions    and the disconnect between how our Administration describes the situation on the ground in Iraq and what Americans see every day on their televisions    have eroded the American public  s support for the war   In addition  these conditions and contradictions have fueled concerns about whether your Administration has a strategy for success that will preserve our fundamental national security interests and permit us to bring our troops home          Last week your Administration was afforded several important opportunities to set forth your plan and lay these concerns to rest   The Secretary of Defense  the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  the Commander of the Central Command  and the Commander of U S  and Coalition Forces in Iraq all appeared before the Congress to report on the Administration  s progress in Iraq   Prior to their appearances in the House and Senate  in a statement from the White House Rose Garden  you specifically encouraged members of Congress to hear what these officials had to say in order to   get the latest information about our strategy    and   the progress in increasing the size and capability of the Iraqi security forces             Unfortunately these officials provided neither the Administration  s strategy for success  nor a record of progress in training and equipping Iraqi forces to take over their own defense   To the contrary  we learned that the Administration has actually lost ground on this score   In June  you said there were   160 000 Iraqi security forces trained and equipped for a variety of missions      And during your Rose Garden statement last week you stated   100 Iraqi battalions are operating throughout Iraq       However  last week the Congress and the American people learned that only one Iraqi Army battalion    less than 1 000 soldiers    is sufficiently trained and equipped to fight without U S  assistance   Additionally  General Casey  testified that the message that our military presence in Iraq is not unlimited has not been communicated forcefully enough to the Iraqis          Other comments by General Casey last week also suggest that your Administration lacks a political strategy to end the insurgency that matches the heroic efforts of our military on the ground   General Case stated     Now  this constitution has come out  and it didn  t come out as a national compact that we thought it was going to be      Indeed  he suggests that he is no longer as optimistic as he once was about the prospect for significant reductions in American troops in 2006 because of unsatisfactory political progress          We are equally dismayed that your Administration has failed to produce broad international participation  both in the months leading up to the war and the years since the conflict started   There appears to be no strategy to involve regional countries as there was in the Balkans in the 1990s and in Afghanistan in late 2001 and 2002   There has been little effort to obtain the contribution of military forces from Muslim nations to dispel the perception of a Western occupation of a Muslim nation   In addition  offers to train Iraqi security forces from countries such as Egypt and France have apparently gone unanswered          The only thing as disturbing as the obvious lack of progress is the Administration  s continuing failure to level with the American people about the current situation in Iraq   This failure only serves to erode the public  s confidence about your Administration  s plan for Iraq   Therefore  Mr  President  in the interest of providing accountability to our troops and taxpayers  we ask again for you to provide direct answers to four critical questions about your Administration  s Iraq policy   Specifically                         How many Iraqi forces must be capable of operating without U S  assistance or with minimal U S  support before we can begin reducing our military presence and when will that number be reached                         What specific measures does the Administration plan to take before and after the October 15th constitutional referendum to forge the necessary political consensus and reconcile the growing sectarian and religious differences   If such consensus is not reached  what policy changes would be required                         What efforts have you made or will you make to attain broader international support  including engaging Iraq  s neighbors and other nations particularly Muslim nations  in the effort to stabilize Iraq                         How should the American people assess the progress in reconstructing Iraq  what are the tangible results of the billions of dollars Americans have provided for Iraq  s reconstruction  does the Administration have a plan to ensure that those who have misused taxpayer funds will be held accountable  how much more will U S  taxpayers be asked to contribute to Iraq  s reconstruction  and what steps is your Administration taking to ensure that their future investment will not be misused          In times past  when asked to explain your Iraq policy to our troops and the American people  you have chosen to reply that we need to    stay the course      But simply staying the current course is not a strategy for success   We are convinced now more than ever that we need to change the course and the fist step is for your Administration to immediately provide answers to these important questions   Simply saying that these answers are   unknowable    or   condition based    is no longer satisfactory   Our troops  their families  and the American people deserve better         Click here for more of Senator Clinton s statements concerning the war in Iraq
