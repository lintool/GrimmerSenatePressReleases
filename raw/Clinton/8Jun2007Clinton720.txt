June 8  2007 Senators Introduce Bipartisan Bill to Create Nationwide System of Background Checks for Long Term Care Workers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Bill Tackles Fraud and Abuse of Vulnerable Elderly Population by Screening Applicants                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC  U S  Senator Herb Kohl  D WI   Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging  and Senator Pete Domenici  R NM  today were joined by original cosponsors Senators Claire McCaskill  D MO   Debbie Stabenow  D MI   Blanche Lincoln  D AR   Carl Levin  D MI   and Hillary Clinton  D NY  in introducing the Patient Safety and Abuse Prevention Act of 2007   The bill would prevent those with criminal histories from working within long term care settings by establishing a nationwide system of background checks   This new system would coordinate abuse and neglect registries with state law enforcement registries  and also add a federal component to the background check by cross referencing potential employees with the FBIs national database of criminal history records   Under the disorganized  patchwork system of background checks that exists today  employers trying to hire caregivers cannot always determine which applicants have records of abuse or a history of committing violent crimes   As a result  predators are sometimes hired to take care of our most vulnerable citizens  working in situations where they can cause enormous harm      If enacted  this legislation could help to prevent many of the tragic tales of physical and financial elder abuse that we hear about from our constituents and read about in our local newspapers  said Chairman Kohl   This bill would close gaping loopholes in our current system of background checks by expanding nationwide a pilot program that has already proven successful in many states    We have a responsibility to protect the most vulnerable from abuse by those hired to care for them   Those who have a propensity to prey on the elderly  the chronically ill and the disabled must be restricted from working with these people  Senator Domenici said   The pilot programs implemented in New Mexico and other states have shown that background checks can help ensure that those in long term care are not exposed to people who would do them harm   I am pleased to co sponsor this bill which will strengthen this program and help protect the most susceptible populations    I am proud to stand with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to introduce legislation that will establish stronger safety measures to protect our loved ones living under the care of others  said Senator McCaskill   While the vast majority of these employees do admirable and invaluable work  we must make sure that those who do not have the patients best interests in mind are being kept out of these facilities    Protecting the health and safety of our most vulnerable citizens should be a top priority  said Senator Stabenow   I am proud that much of this legislation is modeled after a successful Michigan pilot program and working together we can expand on its progress    Combating elder abuse should be a national priority  and background checks can be an important tool in preventing the neglect and exploitation of the most vulnerable among us  Senator Lincoln said    We have a critical responsibility to ensure the safety of our most vulnerable citizens  Senator Levin said   By permitting employers to perform background checks on nursing home employees and applicants  we can help to cut down on abuse in facilities for disabled and elderly people   Michigan is fortunate to have been the site of a pilot program that has proven very successful  and we are hoping to be able to expand this program across the country    As the baby boomers begin to reach retirement  it becomes increasingly important to have federal policies that promote positive aging and protect the well being of our nations seniors   Thats why I am pleased to support the Patient Safety and Abuse Prevention Act of 2007  which will expand and strengthen states abilities to safeguard against abuse and neglect in long term care facilities   While its important to find ways to help seniors remain in their homes  we must also ensure that all older Americans  wherever they may live  are able to enjoy their golden years in safe and nurturing environments  said Senator Clinton    Under the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003  MMA   the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has been conducting a pilot program in seven states to implement efficient  equitable systems that cost effectively screen out certain applicants for employment in long term care facilities   Applicants excluded are those whose backgrounds include findings of substantiated abuse and or a serious criminal history   Forty one states already require a criminal background check of some variety  mostly at the state level   The pilot states have integrated their systems to coordinate these checks in a single streamlined process and have added a federal background check through the FBIs Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System    The results from the pilot programs are thus far very impressive   Among the seven states  Michigan boasts the only statewide system and also the most thorough data in terms of the systems results   In the first year of operation  Michigan excluded more than 3 000 people with records of abuse or a disqualifying criminal history  As of April 30  2007  625 of these were excluded through a fingerprint check   Twenty five percent of these exclusions were identified through an FBI check only  a fact that state officials believe indicates that these individuals committed crimes in other states  or have been avoiding prosecution within the state   This statistic reinforces the need for the Patient Safety and Abuse Prevention Act of 2007  which includes the compulsory FBI check    In a letter  the AARP conveyed its support for the bill  stating  Individuals with criminal convictions or histories of abuse can pose a significant risk to persons receiving long term care     This bill would make significant strides in protecting individuals across the country receiving long term care services   The letter also touched on the importance of eliminating the loopholes present in todays haphazard system of background checks  which vary state to state   A system of national criminal background checks is especially critical  given the mobility of todays workers  the turnover in the long term care workforce  and the fact that it is not unusual for individuals to work in multiple states    By expanding this model nationwide  the resulting system would greatly enhance the probability of identifying individuals with criminal backgrounds who can now easily escape detection   Currently  the MMA pilot program is scheduled to end this September    This bill is supported by the Elder Justice Coalition  the National Citizens Coalition for Nursing Home Reform  the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging  AARP and many other organizations dedicated to protecting our nations vulnerable citizens
