October 24  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Development  Relief and Education for Alien Minors  DREAM  Act                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Washington  DC  More than 65 000 immigrant students will graduate from U S  high schools this year only to see the doors of opportunity closed to them   These are gifted and highly motivated children who grew up in the United States   For these children  many of whom arrived to this country as babies  America is the only home they know   They speak English fluently  and for many it is their first and only language   Many have never even visited the country of their birth   They have been educated in our public school system   They have stayed in school and stayed out of trouble   These kids are honor students  team captains  student body presidents and valedictorians       Many would like nothing more than to contribute to the only country theyve ever known as home   But for these children  because of their immigration status  they are often effectively barred from pursuing a post secondary education and reaching their full potential   Through no fault of their own  they are forced to live in the shadows and denied their chance at achieving their God given potential      What are we saying to these hard working students   Well I will tell you   We are saying they are not welcome in the only country they have ever known   We are telling them to go back to another country they often know little about  where they may not speak the language  or understand the culture   These are children caught at a crossroads  and rather than providing them with an opportunity  we are holding them accountable for the actions of their parents      This is not the America I know    There is a solution to this crisis  but sadly  the Senate today failed to act   The DREAM Act  which I have proudly cosponsored for several years  would help expand opportunities for our nations immigrant children   For those students who have grown up in the United States  have demonstrated good moral character  and are pursuing a college education or have enlisted in the military  the DREAM Act will provide an opportunity to earn legal status in this country    There are many good reasons to enact the DREAM Act   In todays twenty first century economy  where a post secondary education is quickly becoming the minimum requirement for higher earning jobs  we need to provide the children in our country with every opportunity to achieve academically  both for their benefit but also for the benefit of our society   The DREAM Act would also strengthen our nations military readiness  allowing these well qualified young men and women to serve their country with honor   But most importantly  the DREAM Act ensures that the promise of the American Dream becomes a reality for all our children    I am disappointed that the Senate failed to pass the DREAM Act   The enactment of this legislation is long overdue  and I will continue to fight for its passage  for all of our children and our nation
