                  Schumer  Clinton  Defense Projects are Vitally Important for the New York Economy and National Security Washington  DC   U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the Department of Defense Appropriations bill conference report filed late yesterday included  87 42 million for military projects in the Southern Tier   The House and Senate must approve the bill before being sent to the President and signed into law           This is great news for the Southern Tier   said Schumer   Additional funds will not only boost the area economy  but also put the Southern Tier and New York State at the forefront of defense technology  As the men and women of our military bravely serve our country all over the world  the funding for these Southern Tier New York defense projects will vastly improve national security technology and will give our armed forces an even greater edge             This is wonderful news for the Southern Tier  This is cutting edge defense technology being made locally  supporting our men and women in uniform and our national security  These are important investments in local companies and research institutions that will in turn help the local economy as well  I look forward to their final approval by the Senate     Senator Clinton said       Corning  Inc    Light Weight  Multi Hit Capable  Vehicle Armor     1 Million    Current transparent armor for military vehicles is based on standard window glass technology   Further development is needed to optimize a fully transparent advanced glass that can be manufactured in sheet form and with improved   multi hit    capability   These advanced glass families can be processed with much greater mechanical properties such as hardness and fracture toughness  significantly improving armor performance for personnel as well as vehicular use  This development work will leverage these glass strengthening technologies to reduce weight and thickness by up to 50   in line with the Army  s goals for this material  and significantly improve vehicle maneuverability and multi hit ballistic strength survivabilty         SUNY Binghamton    Advanced Microelectronics Manufacturing     1 95 million     This bill appropriates   million in funding for the SUNY Binghamton Center for Advanced Microelectronics Manufacturing  CAMM   a national microelectronics manufacturing R center established at Binghamton University in 2005  This funding will help the center to become an engine for economic growth and innovation in the Southern Tier by spurring the creation of high tech regional companies to partner with the center and by driving the creation of a significant number of new jobs  Microelectronics science and engineering represent a strategic area where investments made now can enhance U S  military and homeland security superiority  while strengthening our nation  s role as a global leader  The CAMM will address fundamental enabling technologies and sciences associated with the development of electronic products on flexible substrates    low cost  mass produced ubiquitous electronics  The expected result is conformable  rugged  lightweight electronic components and innovative products for commercial  consumer and military markets        Schweizer Aircraft Company   U S  Navy RQ 8 Fire Scout VTUAV     37 570 million from the President  s Budget    The bill supported  37 57 million requested in the President  s budget for the U S  Navy RQ 8 Fire Scout VTUAV  The RQ 8 is the Navy  s vertical takeoff landing  VTOL   tactical unmanned aerial vehicle  TUAV   It is used for gathering intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance data  as well as to designate targets for precision guided munitions  This system provides situational awareness and real time information to support the tactical commander  s mission requirements  The RQ 8 is the only totally autonomous  tactical unmanned aerial vehicle in today  s inventory intended to support a broad spectrum of naval ship requirements  The U S  Navy has selected Fire Scout as the UAV Mission Package for the Littoral Combat Ship and DDX  The inherent ability of Fire Scout to operate aboard a wide variety of naval platforms insures its availability to fleet commanders in disparate environments and conditions  The  37 6 million that was included in the President  s budget will enable the Navy to purchase four additional vehicles        Johnson Outdoors  Inc   Modular General Purpose Tent Systems  MGTPS     1 65 Million    Johnson Outdoors   JOI    with headquarters in Binghamton  New York  is one of the top four domestic suppliers of military tents to the armed forces   According to the DOD  the MGPTS is the tent system most demanded by the armed forces  comprising 56 percent of all planned tent purchases   JOI employs approximately 200 skilled workers at its plant in Binghamton and is directly or indirectly responsible for hundreds of additional skilled manufacturing jobs at its suppliers  manufacturing facilities       Schweizer Aircraft Company   MQ 8B Fire Scout VTUAV     40 5 Million approved from the President  s Budget    Fire Scout is a Vertical Take off and Landing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle  VTUAV  selected by the U S  Army as the Class IV UAV for Future Combat System  The Army Commanders engaged in Operation Iraqi Freedom often cite UAVs as a pressing need  This funding will be used to accelerate fielding of the Fire Scout  The Fire Scout is used for gathering intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance data  as well as to designate targets for precision guided munitions  This system provides situational awareness and real time information to support the tactical commander  s mission requirements         L 3 Communications   Gunner Crew Chief Station  GCCS  Program    1 Million    Funding will be used to develop a Helicopter Door Gunner and Crew Chief Trainer allowing for the training of crewmembers in operating weapons systems on helicopters  The project responds to an urgent request established by Commanding General  101st Airborne Air Assault Division in preparation for deployment of air assault forces to Iraq  The funding will allow for better technology and better training for soldiers in combat       Susquehanna Resources and Environment  Inc   SRE    Imagery Applications for Fixed and Mobile Sites    2 75 Million    IMaG ATC program is part of the overarching DoD directed Distributed Common Ground Surface System  DCGS   which has developed a strategy and a roadmap to build and integrate a series of multi INT interoperable processing systems   These systems will provide the warfighter a network centric capability to search  receive and display single and multi INT data and information from anywhere within the battle space       Dresser Rand    Advanced Steam Turbine    1 million    The advanced steam turbine will help the Navy meet their requirement to develop technologies and systems for submarines that will match or excel current systems capability while significantly reducing the acquisition and life cycle costs  The development of an advanced steam turbine  using similar magnetic bearings technology  is estimated to reduce the cost the Navy is paying today by as much as 40 percent  Additionally  through improved efficiencies  the expectation is a turbine with more Effective Full Power Hours  EFPH  during its life
