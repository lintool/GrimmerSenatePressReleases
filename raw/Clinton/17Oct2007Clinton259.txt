October 17  2007 Schumer  Clinton Announce Senate Approval of  1 Million for University at Albany s Nanotechnology Center                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Bill Designates a Partnership Between University at Albany s College of Nanoscale Science and NIST  Making It a National Center of Excellence for Nanotechnology R                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Washington  DC   U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the full Senate has approved the Commerce  Justice  Science  and Related Agencies FY08 Appropriations Bill which includes  1 000 000 for the The New York Center for National Competitiveness in Nanoscale Characterization  NC 3 at the University at Albany  The bill also includes language which makes the Center one of six centers in the country to be working with the Department of Commerce on nanotechnology research   The bill will now proceed to a Conference Committee where the House and Senate will resolve the differences between their versions  Following conference  the bill will again be sent to the House and Senate for final approval  after which it will be sent to the President for his signature  Senate approval is great news for Albany and the entire Capital Region  as well as an important step in the appropriations process  said Senator Schumer   This crucial funding will cement the partnership between NIST and U Albany making this research hub a national center of excellence and a leader in nanotechnology research   Not only will this underscore the Universitys position at the forefront of nanotechnology research but it will attract many companies to the area  creating new jobs and making Albany and New York companies competitive in the global market   Furthermore  having this federal research center here in Albany ensures that the government is giving money back to New York taxpayers   This is the beginning of a sustainable relationship that will continue to benefit all involved for years to come    This is a great step in promoting the Capital Region as a national leader in nanotechnology research and development  The provisions of this bill include not only funding for the Centers research  but also make official the Centers inclusion as one of six institutions in the country that will be working with the Department of Commerce on nanotechnology research   I am thrilled that my colleagues in the Senate recognize the importance of this research and development  and Im pleased that this New York institution will be working with other elite centers around the country to advance the state of the art in this groundbreaking field  Senator Clinton said    The  1 000 000 of federal funds will be used for The New York Center for National Competitiveness in Nanoscale Characterization  NC 3  a partnership between the National Institute for Science and Technology  NIST  and the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering  CNSE  of the University at Albany to advance nanoscale metrology innovations and strengthen the resulting RD manufacturing commercialization eco system  in accordance with the report entitled Sustaining the Nations Innovation Ecosystem by the Presidents Council of Advisors on Science  Technology  PCAST       In addition  the following language  which designated the Center as a partner with the NIST  was included in the legislation    The College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering at the University at Albany is the first college in the world devoted exclusively to the research  development and deployment of innovative nanoscience  nanoengineering and nanoeconomics concepts  CNSE is located in the most advanced research complex of its kind at any university in the world  The  3 billion  450 000 square foot complex attracts corporate partners from around the world and offers students a one of a kind academic experience  and it is growing  The complex is also home to CNSEs New York State Center of Excellence in Nanoelectronics  The CNSE complex  financed through more than  500 million in governmental support and over  2 5 billion in corporate investments  houses the only pilot prototyping facilities in the academic world for the two standard sizes in computer chip design    the 200 millimeter  or 8 inch  wafer  and the 300 millimeter  or 12 inch  wafer  CNSE has more than 150 U S  and worldwide partners  including some of the world s largest semiconductor and semiconductor related tool manufacturing companies  The work under way is the fastest growing research area at U Albany  and includes efforts to develop  magnetically doped semiconductors with the potential for faster computer processing speeds with lower power consumption  the creation of sensor chips that can instantaneously and non invasively check the bloodstream for glucose levels as well as disease  working models of products that employ alternative power technologies  such as fuel cells  microturbines  and solar cells  and NEMS  nanoelectricmechanical structures  that enable chips to exercise decision making capabilities  These projects are just three of many that have attracted over  1 billion in funding from organizations which want to be at the forefront of nanotechnology research  including IBM and the US Navy
