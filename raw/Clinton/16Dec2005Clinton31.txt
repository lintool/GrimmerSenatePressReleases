December 16  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the USA Patriot Act Reauthorization Conference Report                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             In the wake of the September 11th terrorist attacks  this body came together    Republicans and Democrats alike    around the shared goal of  preventing a similar tragedy from ever occurring again on our soil   Towards this end  Congress worked in a bipartisan manner to pass the provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act  legislation that expanded many of our laws  providing our government and law enforcement with the tools needed to ably combat these threats   We understood then  as we do now  that these tools are important in our fight against terrorism   And because there is no greater responsibility that we bear as members of this body than ensuring the safety of our citizens  I voted in favor of the USA PATRIOT Act in 2001 and supported its reauthorization when the Senate considered its bill earlier this year       But even in the immediate aftermath of the September 11th tragedy  Congress recognized that in its haste to give law enforcement these expanded powers  there was a risk that this new authority was coming at the expense of constitutionally guaranteed rights and liberties   And so in the wisdom of both Republican and Democratic legislators  several provisions of the Patriot Act included four year sunsets  allowing Congress the opportunity to revisit whether the Patriot Act strikes the proper balance between securing our safety and ensuring our freedom        I have very serious concerns that the current Patriot Act Reauthorization conference report  which was negotiated largely without the input of Democrats  does not do enough to strike this proper balance   I believe that we can be both safe and free   The conference report falls well short of achieving that goal   I am hopeful that bipartisan negotiations can result in a compromise bill like the one agreed to in the Senate in July  a bill which did a far better job of protecting our civil liberties        The current conference report fails in many respects         Section 215 of the Patriot Act gives law enforcement in domestic intelligence investigations nearly limitless power to obtain all types of personal records  including business  library  and medical records   Under current law  the government merely needs to demonstrate that the records it seeks are   sought for    a terrorism investigation   Upon such a showing  a secret court is required to issue the order   This is an extremely lenient standard  one that for the first time gives the government almost unchecked access to the sensitive personal information of innocent Americans    To compound matters  the third parties    business  libraries  hospitals  and the like    who are recipients of these orders are subject to an automatic gag order   They cannot tell anyone that they have been asked for these records  including the person whose documents the government is seeking       Given its broad scope  this provision has tremendous potential for abuse   Innocent Americans should not be subjected to these possible intrusions when adequate safeguards can be written into the law  ones that would not sacrifice the utility of these orders as a law enforcement tool   Americans should not have to hope that the government will demonstrate self restraint in its exercise of this power  nor should they fear that their personal records will be part of a government fishing expedition         The Senate bill  which I supported  not only required the government to meet a higher standard before issuing these orders  it also gave recipients of a FISA order an explicit and meaningful right to challenge these orders and their accompanying gag orders in court   The conference report sadly retains a variation of the current law  s exceptionally lenient standard of review  a standard that effectively turns the courts into little more than a rubber stamp   Further  the conference report does not give the recipient of a FISA order any express right at all to seek meaningful judicial review of its gag order   Quite simply  the conference report places inadequate checks on these orders         Another failure of the conference report was exposed in an article appearing in the Sunday  November 6  2005 edition of The Washington Post  which brought to light a very troubling practice by the FBI that underscores the importance of adopting proper safeguards       National Security Letters  NSLs  are administrative subpoenas that allow the FBI to obtain sensitive information about ordinary Americans in national security cases   NSLs are issued by FBI agents without the authorization or approval of a judge  grand jury or prosecutor   While the FBI has long employed NSLs  the Patriot Act greatly expanded their scope  significantly lowering the standard for their issuance   The result has been  according to The Washington Post  a   hundredfold increase    in their use  with the FBI annually issuing thousands of NSLs demanding private information about ordinary Americans not necessarily suspected of any crime   These records include financial  library  credit card  telephone  internet service provider  and email records as well as customer transaction information   These NSLs are governed by strict gag orders that prevent companies from telling their customers that their records were given to the FBI       As this description suggests  NSLs are very similar to Section 215 FISA orders  but with one very critical difference    NSLs do not require the government to get any court approval whatsoever   While NSLs can be an important tool in our fight against terrorism  their unfettered and unchecked use makes them susceptible to abuse that infringes upon the privacy of innocent people   The Senate version of the Patriot Act Reauthorization bill created important checks on the power to issue and enforce NSLs    protections absent from the conference report    without hindering the effectiveness of this law enforcement tool         Other sections of the conference report give rise to additional concerns   The conference report would give law enforcement the free wheeling power to impose roving   John Doe    wiretaps without the safeguards needed to protect innocent Americans from unnecessary surveillance  casting aside important checks on this power that were included in the Senate bill   The report would also give the FBI the right to enter and search a home or business without providing notice to the owner of the residence of business for a month or longer after the search   And the conference report contains a provision that seriously curtails the habeas corpus rights of prisoners to challenge their convictions in court   This provision was in neither the House nor Senate bills  and there has been practically no debate on the merits of this change       Apart from the serious civil liberties concerns  perhaps the greatest shortcoming of the conference report is its failure to incorporate a threat and risk based formula for the allocation of critical homeland security funds to our local communities  states  and first responders   This deficiency was emphasized just last week by the former 9 11 Commission  who issued a blistering indictment of our Homeland Security failures       As I said earlier  I have long maintained that protecting the security of our citizens and our Homeland is the most important responsibility I bear as a U S  Senator   To that end  I believe that to truly make America safe  we need to carefully allocate our Homeland Security resources   We need to make sure that the money gets to where it is needed  that our American cities and states living under the greatest threat receive the funding they need to protect themselves   Unfortunately  up until now  a substantial portion of our Homeland Security money has been allocated according to congressionally mandated formulas that bear little relation to need and risk        Our resources should be dedicated to addressing our most glaring weaknesses   During their negotiations  I encouraged my House and Senate colleagues considering the Patriot Act reauthorization bill to account for this reality in our Homeland Security funding   I have maintained    as the former 9 11 Commission reiterated in its report last week    that lawmakers should cease playing politics with the allocation of our limited resources by promoting distribution formulas that ignore risk and threat    The Commission  s report card was a condemnation of this Administration and the Congress  both of whom have demonstrated far too little urgency in enacting the reforms needed to properly secure our Homeland and fight the War on Terror         The former 9 11 Commission sent a clear  discernable message to the entire nation last week    reform is needed at all levels of government   The failure to incorporate in the Patriot Act conference report a much needed threat based formula for the allocation of Homeland Security funds is a major shortcoming and needs to be corrected       As I noted at the outset  apart from these concerns  the Patriot Act contains provisions that provide law enforcement with important tools in the War on Terror   Because we cannot afford to be without these tools  I am supporting bipartisan legislation that will extend the sunsetting provisions of the Patriot Act by three months   Just because we are coming up against the end of the year does not mean we should have to compromise the rights of law abiding Americans   This extension will preserve the current state of the law on a temporary basis  giving those working on the bill the opportunity to craft a compromise that both safeguards our liberty and gives our law enforcement the capabilities they need to effectively combat and investigate terrorist threats   I am also hopeful that during this three month extension  those working on the reauthorization bill will heed the call of the former 9 11 Commission and include provisions that mandate the distribution of Homeland Security funds on the basis of threat and risk        While we all recognize the importance of equipping our law enforcement with the tools they need to effectively combat terrorism  we also must ensure that those tools are administered in a manner that does not unnecessarily restrict the freedom and liberty that are the hallmark of American life   Like all Americans  I am troubled by recent reports that the President signed an order in 2002 that authorized the National Security Agency to conduct domestic spying on U S  citizens and foreign nationals in the United States  despite legal prohibitions against such activity   Likewise  I am disturbed by recent reports that the Department of Defense is maintaining a database in order to monitor the activity of peaceful anti war groups   The balance between the urgent goal of combating terrorism and the safeguarding of our most fundamental constitutional freedoms is not always an easy one to draw   However  they are not incompatible and unbridled and unchecked executive power is not the answer       I believe the conference report falls short of this goal  and I am hopeful that with more time  those negotiating these provisions will find the proper balance
