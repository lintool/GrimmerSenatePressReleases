July 10  2006 Schumer  Clinton Urge Feds to Designate Schott Lithotec in Poughkeepsie as A Foreign Trade Subzone                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Senators Call On Department Of Commerce To Allow Duty Exemption On Specialized Raw Glass To Eliminate Cost Disadvantage Faced by NY Company      Schott Lithotec USA Employs 80 People In Poughkeepsie And Makes Highly Specialized Glass Products Used By Semiconductor Industry                                                                                                                            Washington  DC   U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today urged the U S  Department Of Commerce to designate Schott Lithotec in Poughkeepsie as a Foreign Trade Subzone to help against an import duty exemption on glass that will eliminate a 4 9 percent cost disadvantage for Schott Lithotec   There are no U S  sources for the special glass substrates imported by Schott Lithotec as a key input  so the company has to import all the raw materials from Japan and Germany   Their primary competitors are also located in Japan  where Schott s competitors can access the raw material locally without duty cost   The industry is highly competitive  and duty costs make a significant impact on a company  s ability to be price competitive   This designation will help to level the playing field with competitors without affecting U S  based suppliers  since there aren  t any for this particular product            Schott Lithotec is an exciting  cutting edge business that hopes to expand in Poughkeepsie and New York State     Senator Schumer said     It is important that our local businesses get what they need to thrive and keep their competitive edge   Schott Lithotec and other technology companies are a shot in the arm for the region and will increase local economic development   It makes no sense for us to have a tariff in place when there are no other domestic producers to protect from foreign competition               Schott Lithotec is a local New York company that is competing with the best of the world  They are also in a unique situation locally  with no domestic producers of their primary component  With 80 employees in Poughkeepsie  Schott Lithotec has made a commitment to the community and hopes to expand that commitment even further  We hope that the Department of Commerce recognizes their individual circumstance and helps us to keep them in business  for their company  s future  for their employees and for their community     Senator Clinton said          Schott Lithotec is a leading supplier world wide of advanced materials and components with customer orientated solutions for the microlithography market   They employ 80 people in Poughkeepsie  New York  and 400 people worldwide   Currently  Schott Lithotec is the only U S  based company capable of supplying advanced photomask blanks to the semiconductor industry   They recently invested  20 million in their Poughkeepsie facility and they have future plans to increase investment and jobs in New York State          The designation as a foreign trade subzone will allow Schott Lithotec to admit the quartz substrates without the payment of duty  manufacture the substrates using U S  labor into the photomask blank  and then bring them into the United States market as a manufactured photomask blank  which bears a lower duty rate of 3 7 percent   This is the same tariff rate applied to the photomask blanks manufactured in Japan and imported into the United States   In addition  foreign trade subzone status will allow Schott to eliminate the payment of U S  duty on both rejected substrates and substrates manufactured into photomask blanks which are subsequently exported   Exports account for nearly 33 percent of Schott  s production          In a personal letter to Andrew McGilvray  Acting Director of the Foreign Trade Zones Board at the U S  Department of Commerce  Schumer and Clinton wrote    We believe that retention and growth of Schott Lithotec  s photomask blank manufacturing facility is an important component of local economic development efforts in the Hudson Valley region of New York  as well as to the United States as a whole   We respectfully request your approval of their application
