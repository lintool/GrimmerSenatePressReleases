Mitchell Field facility and  1 5 million for Cold Spring Harbor for its Center for Women  s Cancer Genetics   The House has approved the bill   The bill must also be approved by the Senate before being sent to the President and signed into law              This is great news for Long Island   said Senator Schumer   Additional funds will not only boost the area economy  but also put the Long Island and New York State at the forefront of defense technology  As the men and women of our military bravely serve our country all over the world  the funding for these Long Island defense projects will vastly improve national security technology and will give our armed forces an even greater edge               Long Island has already proven to the world its leadership in cutting edge defense research and technology   Senator Clinton said   This new funding will help protect our troops  both at home and abroad  and is an important investment in our local companies and the communities they support                                                         5 million of the federal funds will go to STIDD Systems  Inc in Greenport  a leader in commercial marine seating and maritime SOF mobility platforms   STIDD currently employs over 60 people and is a prime supplier of underwater submersibles and shock mitigating seats to the Department of Defense Special Operations Forces    The funding will be used to support USMC evaluation of variants of the Surface Planning Wet Submersible  SPWS  for use as a multi role support craft  MRSIC  in support of underwater reconnaissance capability                                                    3 5 million of the federal funds will go for the F 16 Advanced Identification Friend or Foe Interrogator at BAE  s facility in Greenlawn  The Advanced IFF  AIFF  provides the F 16 aircraft with the ability to identify individual aircraft  both within and beyond visual range   This is critical to timely identification and sorting of air traffic encountered by our F 16s operating in the Homeland Defense role              1 8 million of the federal funds benefit EDO Corporation for the B 1B Pneumatic Assisted Release  PAR  Bomb Rack Upgrade  This funding will be used for producing PAR Bomb racks  and completing flight testing requirements  The introduction of the PAR in the B 1B Fleet will drastically reduce maintenance requirements  use of consumable and hazardous explosive bomb release devices and increase weapons launch reliability             1 8 million in federal funds will go to Northrop Grumman Corporation  Melville  for AN SPQ 9B Shipboard Radar Transmitter Upgrade   Funding will help complete the transmitter back fit of all 20 existing AN SPQ 9B shipboard radars   When all planned 122 radars are deployed  an estimated  4 5 million per year in repair costs will be avoided   Replacement of the existing Government Furnished Equipment transmitter with the improved transmitter will improve the AN SPQ 9B  s detection of low flying missiles in heavy clutter and also improve the detection and tracking of small surface craft such as bog hammers  jet skis  inflatable craft and speed boats   This funding enables the AN SPQ 9B to keep pop up targets in track and facilitates 3D volumetric surveillance   It also accelerates the completion of the AN SPQ 9B radar transmitter retrofit program  which provides the Navy with a more reliable  improves reliability by a factor of 50  and capable transmitter   The AN SPQ 9B program office PEO IWS 2 0 and the OPNAV sponsor  N 76  strongly support the initiative   Fourteen transmitter upgrades are being procured using FY04 05 funding   Six upgrades remain and the federal funds will complete the final six upgrades            1 2 million in federal funds will benefit Advanced Energy Systems for development of a THz   Terahertz  THz  electromagnetic radiation in the frequency range from 0 1 to 30 THz  is the last unexplored frontier in imaging science and technology  whose application holds great promise for medical imaging  counter terrorism and homeland security  drug discovery and concealed explosive detection   Under certain conditions  THz beams  which are non ionizing and hence generally safe to broadcast  can go through clothing and other common materials  and can recognize and identify biological and plastic materials through their spectral signatures   This gives this portion of the spectrum a unique niche  making it extremely well suited for non destructive evaluation  NDE  and for plastic explosive detection   With the recent increasing peacekeeping role of the US military  protection against improvised explosive devices  IED  and land mines has assumed ever increasing importance  Given sufficient radiated THz power for wide field of view  FOV  detection through soil and other materials  a compact THz system could image concealed explosives and spectrally interrogate suspicious objects           1 5 million in federal funds will benefit Advanced Acoustic Concepts   Common Acoustic Sensor Initiative   Funding for this program will be utilized to improve the ability of the Transition Acoustic Intercept system currently in use aboard submarines and surface ships to better detect  classify and locate submarines           1 2 million in federal funds will benefit Lockheed Martin    Undersea Systems  Mitchell Field  for SSN Navigation Enhancement Module   The FY  06 funding will demonstrate the extended WSN 7 navigation performance achieved via implementation of gravity  bathymetry  and ground speed navigation technology    Confirmation of the more covert WSN 7 operational capabilities provided by these technologies would enable the SSN fleet to implement these navigation solutions in a timely manner to support future covert mission requirements  e g  mine warfare and SOF operations  where access to GPS satellites might be denied   These same capabilities would be applicable to support anticipated requirements for SSGN operations and certain surface ship applications             1 million in federal funds will go to SUNY Stony Brook Center for Cancer Prevention through Remote Biological Sensing   The funds will be used to develop a program for cancer detection and prevention through the use of implanted wireless sensors  complex computing  and nanotechnological drug delivery           1 5 million in federal funds will go to Cold Spring Harbor for its Center for Women  s Cancer Genetics  The Center for Woman s Cancer Genetics will identify major cancer genes in breast and ovarian cancers  Experiments will also work on drug treatments and help develop new medicines for cancer patients   The funding will go toward identifying genetic differences between cancer cells and normal cells in breast and ovarian cancer to better our understanding of how to detect and attack the cancer  improving methods for diagnosing cancer in patients so treatments can be tailored to the unique chemical makeup of the individual s disease  and aiding in the discovery of new treatment approaches that can target cancer cells while leaving normal cells untouched   The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory will use the Center for Women s Cancer Genetics to build on its previous successes in cancer gene discovery  James D  Watson  CSHL President  was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1962 for co discovery of the DNA double helix  The Lab s other achievements include Nobel Laureate Barbara McClintock s theory of transposable genetic elements  and Nobel Laureate Alfred D  Hershey s demonstration that DNA is the molecule of heredity
