December 27  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Death Of Benazir Bhutto                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I am profoundly saddened and outraged by the assassination of Benazir Bhutto  a leader of tremendous political and personal courage  I came to know Mrs  Bhutto over many years  during her tenures as Prime Minister and during her years in exile   Mrs  Bhutto s concern for her country  and her family  propelled her to risk her life on behalf of the Pakistani people  She returned to Pakistan to fight for democracy despite threats and previous attempts on her life and now she has made the ultimate sacrifice  Her death is a tragedy for her country and a terrible reminder of the work that remains to bring peace  stability  and hope to regions of the globe too often paralyzed by fear  hatred  and violence     Let us pray that her legacy will be a brighter  more hopeful future for the people she loved and the country she served  My family and I extend our condolences and deepest sympathies to the victims and their families and to the people of Pakistan
