February 14  2007 Clinton  No Military Action on Iran Without Congressional Authority                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Iran is a Threat but U S  Must Proceed Wisely Before Acting in Light of White House Blunders in Iraq            Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton said that President Bush must get authorization from Congress before taking military action against Iran in a speech on the floor of the U S  Senate this afternoon   Saying that Iran poses a threat to U S  allies and interests  Clinton said that no option can be taken off the table in the effort to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons but that the United States must proceed deliberately and wisely            Citing the Bush Administration s blunders and mismanagement of Iraq  Clinton said   It would be a mistake of historical proportion if the administration thought that the 2002 resolution authorizing force against Iraq was a blank check for the use of force against Iran without further congressional authorization   Nor should the President think that the 2001 resolution authorizing force after the terrorist attacks of 9 11 in any way authorizes force against Iran  If the administration believes that any  any use of force against Iran is necessary  the president must come to Congress to seek that authority        The full text of Senator Clinton s remarks follows       Mr  President  at this moment of challenge for our nation  the vantage point of this august chamber  we look onto a world filled with danger  deeply complex threats against our troops and our national interests abroad  and genuine risks to our security here at home  Keeping our nation strong and our people safe requires that we employ the best and smartest strategies available                       In confronting enemies and threats  we are fortunate to possess a great many assets  all of which we must wisely deploy  including our military  diplomatic  economic  and cultural assets  Our strongest asset remains the democracy that we are privileged to take part in as members of the Senate and as representatives of our constituents  Our democratic institutions  under our Constitution  balance one another and check against excesses and concentrations of power that help us wrestle with difficult challenges in an open and forthright way  This constitutional framework is not an obstacle to pursuing our national security  but the example that we should project to the world  Our democracy  with its tradition of accountable power and open debate  is America at its best  And that s what we need  America at our best  as we deliberately and resolutely confront the threat posed by the Iranian regime                       Now  make no mistake  Iran poses a threat to our allies and our interests in the region and beyond  including the United States  The Iranian president has held a conference denying the Holocaust and has issued bellicose statement after bellicose statement calling for Israel and the United States to be wiped off the map  His statements are even more disturbing and urgent when viewed in the context of the regime s quest to acquire nuclear weapons  The regime also uses its influence and resources in the region to support terrorist elements that attack Israel  Hezbollah s attack on Israel this summer  using Iranian weapons  clearly demonstrates Iran s malevolent influence even beyond its borders  We also have evidence  although it is by no means conclusive  of attacks using Iranian supplied or manufactured weaponry against our own American soldiers  As I have long said and will continue to say  U S  policy must be clear and unequivocal  We cannot  we should not  we must not permit Iran to build or acquire nuclear weapons  And in dealing with this threat  as I ve also said for a long time  no option can be taken off the table                       But America must proceed deliberately and wisely  and we must proceed as a unified nation  The smartest and strongest policy will be one forged through the institutions of our democracy  That is the genius of our American system and our constitutional duty  We have witnessed these past six years   until the most recent election of a new Congress by the American people   the cost of congressional dereliction of its oversight duty  a vital role entrusted to Congress by our constituents  enshrined in  and even required by our Constitution  So we are here today because the price that has been paid in blood and treasure  through the rush to war in Iraq and the incompetence of its execution and managing the aftermath  in the excesses of military contracting abuses and the inadequate supply of body armor and armored vehicles on the ground have led to a loss of confidence among our allies and the American people in this Administration  Therefore  Mr  President  we cannot and we must not allow recent history to repeat itself                       We continue to experience the consequences of unchecked Presidential action  Sunlight is the best disinfectant  but this President was allowed  for too long  to commit blunder after blunder under cover of darkness provided by an allied Republican Congress                       In dealing with the threats posed by the Iranian regime  which has gained its expanding influence in Iraq and the region as a result of the Administration s policies  President Bush must not be allowed to act without the authority and oversight of Congress  It would be a mistake of historical proportion if the Administration thought that the 2002 resolution authorizing force against Iraq was a blank check for the use of force against Iran without further Congressional authorization  Nor should the President think that the 2001 resolution authorizing force after the terrorist attacks of 9 11  in any way  authorizes force against Iran  If the Administration believes that any  any use of force against Iran is necessary  the President must come to Congress to seek that authority                       I am deeply concerned by the recent statements coming out of the Bush Administration  The Administration has asserted evidence of the Iranian regime s complicity  at the highest levels  for attacks within Iraq  Yet at the same time  General Peter Pace  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  questions these as assertions  in particular  the capability and intentions of the Iranian government  In this delicate situation  while making disturbing comments   there are reports that the Administration  is sending a third aircraft carrier to the Gulf                       The President owes an on going consultation to this Congress and owes straight talk to the country  We have to get this right  The Congress should debate our current course  including the current silent treatment policy toward our adversaries  I believe we can better understand how to deal with an adversary such as Iran if we have some direct contact with them  I think that can give us valuable information and better leverage to hold over the Iranian regime  And if we ever must  with Congressional agreement  take drastic action  we should make clear to the world that we have exhausted every other possibility                       I welcome the agreement announced yesterday between the United States and North Korea  It demonstrates the central value of using every tool in our arsenal to achieve our objectives  I only wish the Administration had pursued this course six years ago when an agreement with North Korea was within reach  The wasted time has allowed North Korea to develop nuclear weapons in the interim  Failure to use diplomacy has damaged our national security interests  The important step forward our country has made with North Korea raises the obvious question  Why will the President refuse to have any kind of process involving Iran as I and others have urged                              The United States engaged in talks with North Korea within a multilateral process  but also had ongoing bilateral discussions  We should have such a process of direct engagement with Iran  as recommended by many  including the Iraq Study Group  We need friends and allies to stand with us in this long war against terrorism and extremism  and to contain and alter the regimes that harbor and support those who would harm us  During the cold war  we spoke to the Soviet Union while thousands of missiles were pointed at our cities  while its leaders threatened to bury us  while the regime sewed discord and military uprisings and actions against us and our allies  That was a smart strategy used by Republican and Democratic Presidents alike  even though it was often a difficult one                      As we discuss potential evidence of Iranian complicity in supplying arms to insurgents  along with the refusal to suspend their nuclear ambitions  we need to deliver a strong message to Iran that we will not stand by and tolerate this behavior  However  we need to deliver that message forcefully through direct talks  The lives of American soldiers are at risk and we should not outsource our discussions with the Iranians on this and other issues  When I say no option should be taken off the table  I include diplomacy                       Currently  our intelligence on Iran is of uncertain quality  We need to examine the facts closely and carefully  No action can or should be taken without explicit Congressional authorization  And knowing what we know now  this body needs a steady stream of real  verifiable intelligence  We  in the Congress  cannot do our part in deciding what needs to be done if we do not know what is happening  And it does not appear that the administration has any real grasp on the facts on the ground  even after all these years  The public unclassified sections of the NIE report recently issued  made it very clear in their conclusions that sectarian violence would still exist in Iraq absent Iran                       So we have a lot to sort out here  We have all learned lessons from the conflict in Iraq  and we have to apply those lessons to any allegations that are being raised about Iran  Because  Mr  President  what we are hearing has too familiar a ring and we must be on guard that we never again make decisions on the basis of intelligence that turns out to be faulty  If we find evidence of potential Iranian complicity  we will take appropriate action  but that requires a partnership to defend and protect America s national security interests between the Congress and the President                      Oversight will also lead to a consensus approach that brings together the best judgments and strategies of our nation and will examine the consequences of action  the reality of any perceived or alleged threat  and the consequences of taking action  I sometimes fear that the word  consequence  has been taken out of the vocabulary of this Administration  We have to look over the horizon  We have to make hard choices among difficult options                       So  Mr  President  there are no easy answers to the complex situations we confront in the world today  but if we do face threats  then Congressional consultation and authorization will bring the American people into the debate  Whatever steps  if any  may be required should be taken by our nation  not just by our President  We must act as Americans  not as members of one party or another  Our nation has been divided by a failed policy and the relentless pursuit of it  We are facing that again with the escalation policy that the President is pursuing today                       Mr  President  if we face up to our constitutional responsibilities as the Congress  if we conduct the oversight that is required  if we exercise our checks and balances  then we are likely to reach a better conclusion than we have thus far  We must be tough and smart  deliberative and wise  and we must look at all of our assets  not just the brave men and women who wear the uniform of our country to implement the best policy  We should start by employing our best values  the democratic values that give strength to our nation and our cause  and that serve as an example and beacon to people who wish to live in peace and freedom and prosperity around the world           Mr  President  I yield the floor                   Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning the war in Iraq
