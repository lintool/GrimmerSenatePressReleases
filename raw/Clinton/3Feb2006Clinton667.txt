February 3  2006 Senator Clinton Urges President Bush to Make Pandemic Flu Preparedness a Top Budget Priority                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today joined 31 of her Democratic colleagues in writing a letter to President Bush calling on him to make pandemic flu preparedness a top priority in his budget for 2007   Last year  the Senate passed legislation co sponsored by Senator Clinton that would have provided  8 billion for pandemic flu preparedness   However  the Republican Senate passed and the President approved funding for pandemic flu preparedness of approximately half the level needed                Our repeated seasonal flu distribution problems should be a wake up call to the crisis we will have on our hands when a pandemic strikes if we fail to address this critical public health challenge     Senator Clinton said     We need adequate funding for pandemic flu preparedness and we need to fix our vaccine delivery system so we are able to adequately handle our seasonal flu vaccine needs as well as the crisis of a flu pandemic             Senator Clinton has introduced legislation with Senator Pat Roberts that would shore up our seasonal flu vaccine production and distribution system to ensure we have the infrastructure needed to respond to both seasonal and pandemic influenza              The full text of the letter to President Bush follows          February 3  2006         President George W  Bush          The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  Washington  D C  20500         Dear Mr  President          We are deeply concerned that our nation remains unprepared for the serious and growing threat of an influenza pandemic   Last year  the Republican controlled Congress passed and you approved  3 8 billion to help protect our nation from a pandemic    less than half the  8 billion passed by the Senate and  3 3 billion less than you determined was necessary for this purpose   As you prepare your fiscal year  FY  2007 budget request for Congress  we hope your budget will make pandemic flu preparedness a top priority and you will work with us to see that Congress provides the resources needed to address this looming crisis            As you know  the H5N1 strain of avian influenza has spread to 15 countries where it has killed 83 of the 152 individuals it has infected   Members of your administration have warned that this virus could mutate to a new strain that will allow for sustained human to human transmission and cause the next pandemic   World Health Organization officials have cautioned that with every new human infection of the H5N1 virus  the possibility increases that it could mutate into a form that can be easily transmitted between humans            The human and economic impact of an influenza pandemic on our nation would be devastating   According to the Department of Health and Human Services  a severe flu pandemic could infect 90 million residents and kill almost two million   A Congressional Budget Office report found that under this scenario  thirty percent of the work force would become ill and those who survived would miss three weeks of work   This lost productivity and decrease in consumer spending could cause a  675 billion reduction in the U S  gross domestic product and move the nation into a recession          Our nation remains dangerously unprepared to address this looming threat   We are not dedicating enough resources to the global surveillance and preparedness activities that will allow us to prevent  detect  or contain an outbreak of avian flu   If we are unable to contain a pandemic overseas  our strongest defense at home will be an effective vaccine   However  our domestic vaccine manufacturing capacity is so inadequate it could take nearly a year to produce and distribute a vaccine   Effective drugs that can slow the spread of a pandemic until a vaccine is developed are available for less than two percent of our population   Finally  all of these problems are compounded by the fact that our public health infrastructure does not have the capacity to handle a pandemic and the medical community  business and general public remain unprepared for a pandemic   If we do not address the funding shortfall for pandemic preparedness  there will be inadequate resources to fund important protections    including global surveillance and containment  vaccine manufacturing capacity  provider and hospital surge capacity  stockpiling of antivirals and other medications  and preparedness of state and local health departments          All of these are reasons why the growing threat of a pandemic requires immediate action  why we voted last year to provide  8 billion in emergency funding for pandemic preparedness  and why we believe significant additional resources are needed this year            In addition  we are concerned about a provision in the FY 2006 Department of Defense Appropriations bill  P L 109 148  that gives sweeping liability protections for the pharmaceutical industry  even for the consequences of reckless wrongdoing  without funding a compensation program for individuals who are injured as a result of new vaccines or medications   While we support reasonable protection for vaccine makers whose products may cause unforeseen or unpreventable harm  these protections must be narrowly tailored and must be accompanied with protections and compensation for injured patients   As we learned from the failed smallpox vaccination effort  the government cannot expect first responders or members of the public to be vaccinated if they do not have assurances that those injured as a result of vaccines or other medications will be compensated for those injuries   We ask that you reconsider this ill conceived  hastily crafted liability provision immediately and request funding for a real compensation program          We hope that you will agree that the serious and growing threat of an influenza pandemic requires swift action and should be made a top priority in your budget   The government  s lack of preparation for this threat is unacceptable    We ask for you to demonstrate your leadership on this issue by requesting the funding needed to address this crisis in your FY 2007 budget request              Sincerely
