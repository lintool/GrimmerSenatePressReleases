                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on the President to provide leadership in addressing the crisis in the housing market and its effect on the nations financial markets  In a letter to President Bush  Senator Clinton noted that several months ago the Chairman of the Federal Reserve indicated that there would be minimal spillover of the subprime mortgage troubles to the rest of the economy and financial system  However  with the bankruptcies of several nationwide mortgage lenders  many more Americans facing the real threat of foreclosure and severe financial market volatility  she underscored that options to address the housing crisis should given more attention than they have been thus far by the Administration    Prudent steps should be seriously debated among federal policy makers to ensure that we are doing everything possible and are not casting a blind eye to the potential economic harm these credit problems could cause to both the national economy and to families facing distress  Senator Clinton wrote  I urge you to begin an open and public dialogue among your economic advisors  the heads of the appropriate federal agencies  Members of Congress and leaders in the private sector to address the issues stemming from the credit market problems  I believe it is important and appropriate for you to demonstrate your willingness to at least discuss the various policy options at our disposal in this challenging market environment   Senator Clinton has been a vocal advocate for taking action to address the growing crisis  help struggling homeowners and improve consumer protections  Senator Clinton has called for a series of steps to aid those holding subprime mortgages and mitigate the mortgage crisis  including   Face to face financial counseling to be made available to more borrowers before they take out mortgages  and to homeowners at risk of foreclosure   Restricting the use of prepayment penalties for responsible borrowers that repay their mortgages ahead of time   Strengthening the Truth in Lending Act and existing federal regulations to ensure that there is plain talk  no fine print disclosure    Senator Clinton also reintroduced the 21st Century Housing Act to strengthen the Federal Housing Administration s  FHA  mortgage insurance program  Senator Clinton has emphasized that FHA loans should be available to more Americans  especially those who are drawn to the subprime market  as FHA backed mortgages are more stable and offer better terms than most subprime mortgages   The following is the text of Senator Clintons letter today to President Bush   August 17  2007  The Honorable George W  Bush The White House Washington  D C  20500  Dear Mr  President   Americans are following the volatility in the markets with great concern  It appears that this volatility stems from the uncertainty confronting millions of Americans who are invested in our housing market  primarily as homeowners  With many Americans facing the threat of foreclosure  the high profile bankruptcies of several nationwide mortgage lenders  and investment funds suffering significant losses from their mortgage investments  it is no small surprise that these conditions have led to broader concerns about the availability of credit    When I wrote Chairman Ben Bernanke this past May  it appeared that the Federal Reserves and the Administrations views were that the problems in the subprime mortgage market were limited and that there would be no significant spillovers from the subprime market to the rest of the economy or the financial system  At that time  I urged the Chairman to maintain vigilance to ensure that steps were taken to protect not only responsible homeowners and homebuyers from the fallout of the subprime market  but also to restore and maintain consumer confidence in our housing market and our economy    However  despite the previous optimistic forecasts  it appears from the significant market losses of the past week that there indeed has been spillover from the subprime market to other components of the financial system  At the same time  you have predicted a soft landing for the housing market and you have also described the current challenges as a necessary reaction to a flood of liquidity that came into the market  While I certainly hope your assessment is accurate  I believe that it is important to remember that this is not simply a market correction  but a real issue with the financial well being of millions of American families at stake    Indeed  there is an inherent level of risk in our free market system  Nevertheless  I am concerned that your public statements may belie the significance of the current challenges facing the market  These challenges matter a great deal to American homeowners and prospective homebuyers  Your statements may signal an unwillingness from the Administration to consider even modest and sensible options that could help bring some stability to the housing market    I do respect the need of federal policymakers to weigh new ideas carefully and to ensure that we do not take actions that have unforeseen negative consequences or whose purpose is solely to rescue major financial players  Nonetheless  prudent steps should be seriously debated among federal policymakers to ensure that we are doing everything possible and are not casting a blind eye to the potentialeconomic harm these credit problems could causeto both the national economy and to families facing distress  I urge you to begin an open and public dialogue among your economic advisors  the heads of the appropriate federal agencies  Members of Congress and leaders in the private sector to address the issues stemming from the credit market problems  I believe it is important and appropriate for you to demonstrateyour willingness to at least discuss the various policy options at our disposal in this challenging market environment    Thank you for your attention to my concerns    Sincerely yours    Hillary Rodham Clinton   Hillary Rodham Clinton
