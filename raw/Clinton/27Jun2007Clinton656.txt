June 27  2007 Keynote Address of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton at the Center for a New American Security                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Toward a New American Security is exactly the right title for this forum  We are in a moment of profound change and challenge that requires new thinking and a new direction  As Americans we bear much responsibility for the global economic  technological  and democratic revolution we are experiencing    Every day the world grows smaller and history moves faster  Decisions by a factory owner in China impact the health and safety of children in Chicago  American researchers use the web to share best practices  but so do Islamist extremists  And pandemics do not know where evil nations end and good nations begin  a fact that Im sure greatly disturbs the Vice President    Amidst the global transformation to an interdependent world our nation confronts possibilities of promise and peril  We know the current security policy with its excessive reliance on unilateral force  its rejection of international agreements of all kinds  and its preference for policy making based on ideology  not evidence  has to change    But lets begin with some basic assumptions rooted in reality  In this interdependent world  the United Stated cannot unilaterally kill  jail  occupy or isolate all of our actual or potential adversaries  Therefore  while a strong military remains essential to our security  it is not sufficient    Moreover  there are few security challenges we can meet entirely on our own  So in the words of Secretary Albright  We should cooperate with others whenever we can and act alone only when we have to  Not the other way around         When I was First Lady  I was honored to visit 82 countries representing our nation  I witnessed the promise of America in the eyes of men  women and children  America represented hope  opportunity  freedom  As a United States Senator I continue to meet with leaders from around the globe and as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee  travel to places where our military has been engaged and performing heroically    And what we have seen here and around the world is that the administration has systematically broken down and thrown aside our hard won partnerships and alliances and undermined our greatest asset  Americas moral authority   not just destroying the work of the previous decade but the difficult work of more than a half century of internationalism practiced by Democratic and Republican administrations alike  All too often the administration has favored ideology over reality  promoted tough talk over tough decisions  and sown alienation instead of cooperation    The next president will take office at a time when the United States faces the greatest confluence of challenges in our countrys recent history  We must regain our place in the world with a new security policy that serves our national interest  recaptures our moral authority  works with our allies  modernizes our military  and confidently projects our values  In short  we must rebuild our strength and widen and deepen its scope    We have to be both internationalists and realists  We have to renew those alliances around the world  around a common set of goals including combating genocide  expanding human rights  promoting reconciliation through diplomacy  stopping nuclear proliferation  and addressing global warming  We have to realize that we are in the middle of a sectarian civil war in Iraq and that it is well past time to start withdrawing our troops in the middle of that war  And we must also realize that the global threat of terror demands that we secure our home front  take on the terrorist networks abroad  and combat a false doctrine of hate  death and destruction    America must be the worlds leader and yet we cannot lead unless we restore the greatness and goodness of America in the eyes of the world  Thats why we must stand for freedom and fairness  justice and progress  peace and security    Let me say a few words about Iraq  I know that CNAS has released a new report on Iraq with a set of proposals for the way forward  I have some differences with the specifics of the proposal  but I believe it is time to end the war and bring our troops home as soon as possible    The failed ideology and flawed decision making that led us into Iraq has had a devastating impact on us here at home and around the world  Iraq continues to steal young American lives and to consume  8 6 billion a month  sapping our military readiness and standing  I traveled to Iraq three times to meet with soldiers and commanders as well as the Iraqi political leaders  There is no doubt that our military has performed heroically and has done what they were asked to do according to the authorization that was passed nearly five years ago    Not a day goes by that I dont think of our men and women who are over there right now  patrolling the streets of Baghdad  Mosul  and other places  trapped by a failed strategy and sectarian civil war and I never stop thinking about the lives that have been lost and the lives that have been so drastically affected by profound injuries    The president claims he listens to our military commanders   but he apparently doesnt hear what I have heard for several years now  General Petraeus  General Casey  General Pace  General Abizaid  Admiral Fallon and others have told him and us  there is no military solution to the Iraq conflict  only a political one    Without concerted U S  led international political and diplomatic efforts  as the Iraq Study Group supported but the Bush Administration disregards  any Iraqi government is condemned to failure  In the absence of credible and strong incentives backed by U S  pressure  the Iraqi government has degenerated into protecting ethnic and sectarian interests  In the absence of sustained diplomatic efforts involving the parties affected and the nations in the region  we risk the expansion of the conflict beyond the borders of Iraq    The coalition building efforts during the first Gulf War and affecting the former Yugoslavia demonstrate that sustained political and diplomatic efforts are critical to establishing and maintaining U S  national security interests  What worked for the first Bush administration and the Clinton administration has been abandoned or executed poorly  It is not a matter of partisanship  it is a matter of learning from lessons of successful American statesmanship of both Democratic and Republican presidents    The catalog of misjudgments offends common sense and shocks the conscience  the unilateral decision to rush to war without allowing inspectors to finish their work or diplomacy to run its course  the failure to send enough troops and the disgraceful lack of equipment for those we sent  the draining of manpower  resources and intelligence capabilities from Afghanistan  the inability to stop rioting or to secure weapons caches  dismantling Iraqs security and governmental capacity  the ignorance of a rising insurgency  and the adherence  which continues to the present day  to a broken policy more than four years after the invasion began    Since 2005  Ive called for the strategic redeployment of U S  Forces out of Iraq  Ive introduced the Iraq Troops Protection and Reduction Act to begin withdrawing our troops  And I continue to press for a basic three step approach that would end the war while preserving our security interests  First  start bringing the troops home now  Second  demand  and back up those demands  that the Iraqis take responsibility for their country or lose the aid we are providing them  And third  begin intensive regional and international diplomacy on a sustained basis    We need to force the administration to change its failed policies in Iraq  Thats why Ive gone further and with Senator Robert Byrd proposed de authorizing the war by October 11  2007  the five year anniversary of the original use of force resolution  Senator Byrd and I plan to offer an amendment de authorizing the war when the Senate considers the Defense Authorization bill after the July 4th recess  Its a civil war in Iraq and we must extricate ourselves from it    Ive also called on both the Secretary of Defense  Secretary Gates  and General Pace  to brief Congress on the existing plans for the withdrawal of US troops from Iraq or to explain why no such detailed plans exist  The seeds of many problems that continue to plague our troops and mission in Iraq were planted in a failure to adequately plan for the conflict that the administration was so anxious to begin  We cannot allow our failures in deploying into Iraq to be repeated when we redeploy out of Iraq    Among the most important reasons for extricating ourselves from Iraq are the looming challenges in the region and around the world to our national security  There is a global threat of terrorism and we have to confront it  Here  too  the policies of the Bush Administration have set us back    America must rely on the intelligence of our allies along with our own  yet the Bush Administrations policies have alienated our friends and emboldened our enemies  New threats require us to modernize and reform our intelligence services  And we find ourselves often trapped in very short sighted  unproductive debates triggered by the Presidents and Vice Presidents desire to expand executive authority beyond any previously imagined limit  It is dangerous for us to be caught up in debates about wiretapping schemes and it is dangerous for the administration to refuse to disavow torture    We are in a long term struggle in which our values must be more than rhetoric  But we are weakened by Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib and by this administrations policies on detainees and torture    I voted against the Military Commissions Act because I believe we have to stand for the rule of law before the world  especially when we are under threat  Democrats and Republicans alike believe that terrorists have to be caught  captured  sentenced  punished  killed  I believe there should be no mercy for those who perpetrated 9 11 and other crimes against humanity  But in the process of accomplishing what is essential for our security we must hold onto our values and set an example we can point to with pride and not shame    The bill allowed the admission into evidence of statements derived from cruel  inhumane  and degrading interrogations  Will our enemies be less likely to surrender  Will informants be less likely to come forward  Will our soldiers be more likely face torture themselves if captured  Will the information we obtain be less reliable  As Lieutenant  General  John F  Kimmons  the Armys Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence has said  No good intelligence is going to come from abusive interrogation practices  Allowing coercive treatment and torturous actions toward prisoners violates the rule of law  fails in intelligence gathering  and promotes radicalization    Al Zawahri  Osama bin Ladens second in command  the architect of many of the attacks on our country  throughout Europe and the world has said over and over again if we would only pay attention  it is on their websites  that torture helps the cause of extremism  watering the seeds of jihad  Ive called for the closing of the prison at Guantanamo Bay because it represents in the eyes of the world abuse  secrecy  and contempt for the rule of law  Rather than keeping us more secure  Guantanamo is harming our national security  It compromises our long term military and strategic interests and impairs our standing overseas    We also cannot allow the failures taking place in Iraq to cause us to lose focus on the war in Afghanistan  The first time I visited Afghanistan in 2003  a young soldier said to me  Welcome to the forgotten front line of the war against terror  This administration is not only failing in Iraq  its inattention risks failure in Afghanistan    During my visit to Afghanistan last January  I heard disturbing reports about continued cross border infiltration from Pakistan into Afghanistan by Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters  The tensions between the Afghan and Pakistani governments were palpable    During my meetings with President Karzai and President Musharraf  I asked if they thought that a special presidential envoy from the United States would help them resolve their disputes and they both expressed the belief that such an envoy could be very useful  When I returned to the United States  I called the White House to suggest a special envoy and to convey the reactions of Presidents Karzai and Musharraf  The White House  however  did not follow up on this idea and the tensions between those two critical countries continue unabated    We must widen the scope of our strength by leading strong alliances which can apply military force when required and promote our values  In the 1990s people were looking toward America for leadership  When ethnic cleansing was taking place in the Balkans  the United States led our European allies in putting together a coalition to stop it  There is no better way to combat anti Americanism than to do our best to demonstrate that America is invested in lifting up people around the world    Some of you have heard this before  but it was striking to me that after President Bush asked his father and my husband to represent our country with respect to the relief following the Tsunami    they traveled together  they were there when our military was evacuating people and bringing in supplies    and the public opinion about the United States increased dramatically in a positive direction based on that very visible show of American concern  most notably in Indonesia where there had been tracking of public attitudes toward us before and after    Instability and extremism fester in places where infrastructure  education  and opportunity are also lacking  Ive introduced the Education for All Act to provide  10 billion over five years toward the goal of basic education for every boy and girl around the world  From Pakistan to Sudan  parents want their children to have an education  but too often governments fail in delivering that basic service or find themselves without the resources to do so even if they are willing  Education is a tool to combat HIV AIDS  empower women  and certainly for economic development  And I believe all of that plays to our strengths    For six years  the threat of terror at home has not been met successfully with a lot of bluster and intimidation  that only isolates us  Its not right and its not smart  The attacks which have been prevented are a result of cooperation with other nations in intelligence  law enforcement and money tracking efforts  And those kinds of cooperative relationships have to be deepened and strengthened    Alliances are also essential in safeguarding against other security threats like pandemics  be they acts of terrorism or acts of God  And there needs to be better cooperation globally for us to be prepared to deal with these kinds of threats    I think its important that we also focus on the most significant threat of all  nuclear proliferation  The 9 11 Public Discourse Project  an outgrowth of the 9 11 Commission  argued that preventing terrorists from gaining weapons of mass destruction must be elevated above all others problems of national security because it represents the greatest threat to the American people  We wouldnt know it by the discussion and dialogue in this city    The Bush Administration has joined the chorus saying that  yes  that is our biggest threat  Unfortunately  their response has foundered at a nexus of ideology and intransigence  They have followed a policy that permitted North Korea  whose plutonium production was frozen by the last administration  to reprocess enough material in the last four years to make half a dozen nuclear bombs and test a nuclear weapon  In the past few months weve seen signs of reversal  but the damage is already done    Iran  meanwhile  has been given six years of the silent treatment  In this vacuum  Iran continues its progress toward developing nuclear weapons and increasing its influence in the region  After initial talks with Iran and Syria on Iraq  the administration says it isnt sure that we need any more discussions with either of them  I think we should keep talking             Rather than engaging those who seek to develop nuclear weapons and working more urgently with allies to secure the nuclear material that al Qaeda and others covet  the administration has abandoned the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and neglected non proliferation and even promoted two new small nuclear weapons  including the robust nuclear earth penetrator  the so called bunker buster    I m introducing the Nuclear Terrorism Prevention Act  a bill based on the report published by the Nuclear Threat Initiative  headed by Senator Sam Nunn  He clearly sees this threat outrunning our response  And my bill seeks to reinvigorate and accelerate our efforts to ensure that the nature and urgency of our response is commensurate with the threat    My legislation would first devote real resources to combating the threat by increasing funding for the Global Threat Reduction Initiative to convert research reactors around the world from highly enriched uranium to low enriched uranium and to remove the highly enriched uranium from such facilities    I was with Warren Buffett last night who has pledged  50 million of his own money to this effort and believes that he could amass an even greater amount of money from the private sector if our government would lead us with some urgency toward taking on this challenge    We need to expand the Materials Protection  Control and Accounting program to lock down nuclear material and invest in forensic measures which advance our ability to discover the origins of a nuclear weapon in the horrific event of an attack    This legislation would also require the president to work to create specific international guidelines to raise the security standards at foreign nuclear sites  To paraphrase Harvards Graham Allison  no access to nuclear materials means no nuclear terrorism    Third  to coordinate these efforts  my legislation would create a senior advisor to the president for the prevention of nuclear terrorism  responsible for an annual report to Congress listing all sites worldwide with nuclear weapons and weapons usable fissile material and for developing and coordinating the implementation of a plan to eliminate  remove and secure all such material    Here  too  we will never be served by policies that isolate us from those who can be our allies in stopping proliferation  And I hope that we will turn to this with greater urgency now  We cannot wait 18 months for the next administration  We should be focused on doing as much as possible as quickly as we can    There are so many other challenges across the board from obviously the Middle East to Latin America  from the ongoing Israeli Palestinian conflict to the ongoing violence in Darfur    The next president will face a rising China with growing economic  diplomatic and military power  China is using its power throughout the world in new ways that challenge our current thinking and policies  We should neither fear a stronger China nor ignore it  That means engagement and understanding  but also frank dialogue on issues ranging from trade to currency manipulation to human rights abuses and the environment    I remember traveling to China in 1995 to represent the United States at the Fourth World Conference on Women  Shortly before the conference was to start  the Chinese government imprisoned a dissident  as some of you might remember  and many felt that we shouldn t go in order to send a strong message of disapproval    But I thought we should send another message  That s why I did go and spoke out about the importance of human rights and particularly emphasizing the importance of women s rights  I don t think we lose by speaking out and engaging with those with whom we disagree  even in profound ways    Latin America presents another challenge  and  again  I think we have ignored developments in Latin America at our peril  The president came into office with great promise but unfortunately it has not been realized  And we must redouble our efforts to create better ties and look for specific projects of development that can perhaps make a difference    The Clinton Foundation just announced a  200 million fund to do just that in Latin America  working for sustainable development and working to train people to do jobs connected with sustainable development    Finally  we face serious challenges in Africa  In Sudan  Zimbabwe and other countries long term conflicts  external and internal  persist  Certainly in the Horn of Africa we see Islamist extremists attempting to lay down roots  And we are watching the Chinese gain influence  building soccer stadiums and parliament buildings    The Pentagon is creating a separate command for Africa  and I fully support that  but they re having a problem figuring out where to place it  because the countries of North Africa are not welcoming us the way that I believe they would have at a previous period    We ve seen what happens when we fail to focus on Africa  The genocide in Darfur is a prime example  The United Nations must do more to hold its member countries responsible for meeting basic human rights standards  And the United States must do more to create an environment in which countries are willing to place their resources at the disposal of the mission to end genocide    We ve got to look for ways that we can create these opportunities within Darfur  If Sudan does not live up to its commitment to allow a full hybrid U N  and African Union peacekeeping force  we should work with NATO to take military action  I would suggest a no fly zone that would be blanketed over Darfur and be focused on the air support that the Sudanese provide to the Janjaweed as they rape and pillage their way through the villages   the bombing comes before  during and after    And I think it is time for us to make a much more serious effort both to support the troops on the ground with airlift and logistics  and to have the threat of the no fly zone and action taken against those who violate it  in order for this new effort that the U N  and the A U  are proceeding with to be successful    But there are some good news stories in Africa that we ve got to do more to support  and I particularly am pleased about Liberia  We ve seen the very impressive presidency of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf  Her commitment to good governance has served as a real example  We have supported debt relief for Liberia  and the Congress is passing that insofar as the American portion of it  But we ve got to do more to help the country rebuild  and to try to create some examples of good governance and positive development in Africa with our help    And  of course  there s global warming  a particular challenge that has security implications  Eleven retired three  and four star admirals  and generals   including General Zinni  had come out with a report entitled  National Security and the Threat of Climate Change  It concluded that global warming did present a serious national security threat because of its projected impacts on reduced access to fresh water and impaired food production  the displacement of populations  the mass migrations that will occur  the failed states  the conflicts over scarce resources    I authored an amendment for the Defense Authorization bill to implement many of the recommendations of this report  It is not the first one  The Pentagon actually did their own report  several years ago  which never saw the light of day to any great extent  And it is time that we clearly focus on global warming as a security challenge    Finally  there is a challenge we face right here at home in trying to figure out how to rebuild our military and transform our government to face the threats of the 21st century and to take advantage of the opportunities    I m a member of the Transformation Advisory Group  which is a part of the U S  Joint Forces Command  I was asked to join several years ago    It s a unique advisory group  charged with thinking of new ideas to move our military and government into a more forward leaning  forward thinking posture    And it s important that we look at the lessons from this group s discussion  that it s not just about what the military can and must do  but how the rest of the government has to be value added and work together in a much more coordinated way    Our increasingly interconnected world demands an interconnected strategy that takes into account political  economic  diplomatic and military concerns  When developing military strategy  our military leaders no longer speak of the battlefield  but they talk about the situation  They are much more adept than many people actually understand  that the battlespace goes far beyond the battlefield  And we need that kind of multidimensional thinking  both inside and outside the walls of the Pentagon    So let s make an effort to increase the number of soldiers proficient in foreign languages  instead of kicking out interpreters who happen to be gay  Let s be sure our policies reflect concern for the will of governments and the perceptions of peoples  Let s make sure that we look just not at the Quadrennial Defense Review but at a document that looks at all of the government s responses to the threats and opportunities we face    You know  despite the professed attempts at military transformation  much more needs to be done  We do need to increase the size of the Army to address the myriad threats that we still face  even after we begin withdrawing from Iraq  We need to reform the Pentagon s acquisition system to rein in the costs of weapons systems and spending on outside contractors  And we need to find the right mix between legacy systems that our service members are currently using and newer programs that will allow us to keep our technological edge Our experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan mean that we must not just learn but incorporate the lessons of asymmetric warfare and train and equip our forces accordingly Finally  we need to re evaluate the entire training and education that service members need in the 21st century    Every challenge we face begins with the biggest challenge  restoring our leadership by once again valuing alliances  respecting our values  and understanding that American strength is more than just a show of force    I want to end with a story that I particularly like  in part because it really does remind me of all that America can be when we have leadership that understands all that America should be    It s a story that Secretary Albright has told  Back in 1995  she was asked to go to Europe to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II    And she was particularly excited about going because she would go to the Czech Republic  having been born and raised in the former Czechoslovakia and having confronted Nazism and communism through her family    So as she traveled around to these various commemorations  she noticed people waving American flags  But as she looked more closely  she realized those flags had only 48 stars    And she kept asking people  Where did these flags come from    And everyone told her the same thing  when the American G I s liberated Europe  they passed out these flags  And people had treasured them  passing them on from grandparent to parent to child  And  in fact  keeping them at some risk to themselves  because if theyd been discovered under Soviet occupation with an American flag  they could have gotten into trouble    So she asked them  Why did you keep these flags for fifty years    And everyone said the same thing  because they loved America and they loved the hope that those flags represented and the values that stood behind them    Well  I want to see a restoration of those feelings about us around the world  But I also want to see their restoration here at home    We have to begin believing again in our goodness and our greatness  in our ability to be both smart and tough  You know  44 years ago this month  President Kennedy spoke just a short distance from where we are today at American University  And he said  I speak of peace because of the new face of war    In this new century  we are confronted by yet another new face of war and a new reality of global interdependence  It is a moment of peril and of promise  How we proceed is entirely up to us  We can repair the damage that has been done to our security and our standing over these past six years  We can rebuild our alliances and restore our moral authority  and reestablish our leadership in the world  And by doing so  we can forge a new American security for this new century
