                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Plan B Delay and Resignation of Dr  Wood Intensify Need for GAO Findings                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC    Following the resignation of Dr  Susan Wood from the FDA over concerns about the FDA  s process for considering the Plan B application for over the counter status  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  and Patty Murray  WA   joined by 11 of their colleagues in the United States Senate  called on the United States Government Accountability Office  GAO  to release the findings of an investigation underway examining the FDA rejection of the Plan B application   In addition to Senators Murray and Clinton  the letter was signed by Senators Edward Kennedy  MA   Maria Cantwell  WA   Barbara Boxer  CA   Jon Corzine  NJ   James Jeffords  VT   Christopher Dodd  CT   Daniel Inouye  HI   Debbie Stabenow  MI   Tom Harkin  IA   Mark Dayton  MN  and Charles Schumer  NY               After more than two years of deliberation on the application  on Friday the FDA announced that the   available scientific data are sufficient to support the safe use of Plan B as an over the counter product   but it still failed to approve Plan B  opting instead to invite public comment on whether the FDA has the authority to approve the application to make Plan B available over the counter   This turn of events leaves the strong impression that concerns about politics have overridden concerns about public health in this process     the Senators wrote              Yours is the only independent investigation underway on this important matter of women  s health  and it has the potential to shed much needed light on the FDA  s actions   We hope you will finish your work in the near future to allow policymakers and the public gain a full understanding of the FDA  s process              The Senators requested the investigation on June 15  2004   The findings have not yet been released nor has an update been provided on the timeframe for release           Senators Clinton and Murray have also urged Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Michael Enzi to uphold his promise to hold a Senate hearing to investigate the extended delays surrounding the over the counter application status of Plan B              The text of the letter follows          The Honorable David M  Walker  Comptroller General  U S  General Accountability Office  441 G Street  NW  Washington  DC 20548         Dear Mr  Walker          On June 15  2004  we requested the General Accountability Office  GAO  commence an audit into the Food and Drug Administration  s  FDA  rejection of an application to make Plan B emergency contraception available without a prescription  We understand the investigation is underway and thank you for GAO  s commitment to a thorough review  We write to ask when you anticipate completing your report and to encourage you to release your findings as soon as possible           As you may know  after more than two years of deliberation on the application  on Friday the FDA announced that the  the available scientific data are sufficient to support the safe use of Plan B as an over the counter product   but it still failed to approve Plan B  opting instead to invite public comment on whether the FDA has the authority to approve the application to make Plan B available over the counter           This turn of events leaves the strong impression that concerns about politics have overridden concerns about public health in this process  As we stated in our letter last June  the FDA s own scientific advisory committee voted overwhelmingly in favor of the product being available over the counter  Over 70 major medical organizations including the American Medical Association  the American Academy of Pediatrics  and the American College of Obstretrics and Gynecologist have weighed in in support of Barr Laboratories application  Yet  the FDA has delayed action on the application time and again          Yours is the only independent investigation underway on this important matter of women s health  and it has the potential to shed much needed light on the FDA  s actions  We hope you will finish your work in the near future to allow policymakers and the public gain a full understanding of the FDA s process           Thank you in advance for your cooperation           Sincerely           Senator Patty Murray  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  Senator Edward Kennedy   Senator Maria Cantwell  Senator Barbara Boxer  Senator Jon Corzine  Senator James Jeffords  Senator Chris Dodd  Senator Daniel Inouye  Senator Debbie Stabenow  Senator Tom Harkin  Senator Mark Dayton  Senator Charles Schumer
