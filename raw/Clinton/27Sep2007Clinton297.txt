                  Currently  1 in 3 women are unaware of emergency contraception  Murray  Clinton  Slaughter bill would initiate a large scale education campaign                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Washington  DC  Today  U S  Senators Patty Murray  D WA  and Hillary Clinton  D NY  introduced Senate legislation that will raise awareness about the availability of emergency contraception also known as Plan B or the morning after pill  The bill authorizes an education campaign to better inform women and healthcare providers of emergency contraception  Representative Louise Slaughter  D NY  has already introduced companion legislation in the U S  House of Representatives    Today  too few women know about emergency contraception because many doctors  hospitals and pharmacists are not providing women with the information they need to understand and access it  said Senator Murray  By raising awareness of the availability of emergency contraception we will help protect women s reproductive health  reduce unintended pregnancies and decrease the number of abortions    I was proud to work with Senator Murray in the fight for an FDA decision on emergency contraception last year Research shows thatemergency contraception is safe and effective for preventing pregnancy  More than 70 major medical organizations  including the American Medical Association  recommend thatPlan B be made available over the counter  And yet  women across the country continue to face access and awareness obstacles when it comes to EC I am pleased to support this legislation that will help women gain information they deserve said Senator Clinton   Greater awarenessof andaccess toEC helps women prevent unintended pregnancies and reduce the need for abortions in the United States  a goal on which we can all agree Rep  Slaughter said  EC has been available over the counter for women 18 and older for more thana year now  Yet  barriers to information and accessstill prevent many women from obtaining and appropriately using EC  We can and must do more toovercome these challenges and ensure women are empowered to make knowledgeable decisions about the reproductive health    Emergency contraception isa concentrated dose of ordinary birth control that can dramatically reduce a womans chance of becoming pregnant if taken soon after sex  Emergency contraception does not cause abortion  rather it prevents pregnancy by inhibiting ovulation  fertilization  or implantation before a pregnancy occurs  Emergency contraception is safe and effective  and last year the FDA approved over the counter sales of the medication for individuals ages 18 and up Senator Murray and Senator Clinton played a critical role in getting the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  to provide that approval after long delays by placing a hold on the Bush Administration s nominee for FDA Administrator    According to The Henry J  Kaiser Family Foundation  1 out of 3 women of reproductive age in the United States remain unaware of the availability of emergency contraception  At present  less than 18 percent of hospitals provide emergency contraception at a woman s request without restrictions  and only one in five ob gyns routinely discuss emergency contraception with their patients   Each year 3 million pregnancies  or one half of all pregnancies in the United States  are unintended  Half of these end in abortion  If emergency contraception is taken within 72 hours after unprotected sex or contraceptive failure  it can reduce the risk of pregnancy by as much 89 percent     Senator Murray s bill directs the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to establish an Emergency Contraception Public Education Program through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention    The program would provide a description of emergency contraception and an explanation of its use  safety  efficacy and availability to nonprofit organizations  consumer groups  institutions of higher education  Federal  State  or local agencies  clinics and the media     The bill is also co sponsored by Senator Max Baucus  D MT   Senator Barbara Boxer  D CA   Senator Maria Cantwell  D WA   Senator Chris Dodd  D CT   Senator John Kerry  D MA   Senator Daniel Inouye  D HI   and Senator Frank Lautenberg  D NJ       Senator Murray s bill directs the Secretary of the
