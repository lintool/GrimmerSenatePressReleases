May 19  2006 Schumer  Clinton Urge Department of Commerce to Halt Unfair Trade Practices that Hurt Syracuse Candle Industry                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Department to Rule on Chinese Candle Imports      Syracuse candle industry continually hurt by circumvention efforts by Chinese candle makers and U S  importers to avoid antidumping tariffs                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC   U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton joined today with a bipartisan group of their Senate colleagues  calling on the U S  Department of Commerce to consider the local candle industry before issuing a determination on Chinese candle imports on Tuesday   The senators are concerned about aggressive efforts by Chinese candle producers to circumvent an Antidumping Duty Order on petroleum wax candles and thus avoid paying the 108 3  duty imposed on their illegal dumping            Nobody knows better than the people of Central New York how the Chinese don  t always play by the rules  especially when it comes to trade     Schumer said    This is yet another example of Syracuse being devastated by China  s unfair trade practices  It is vitally important that the Department of Commerce take a particularly close look at the petition before them               We have such a proud history of candle making in New York and we must prevent foreign manufacturers from unfairly seeking a greater market share in the U S  We hope that the Department of Commerce will look at the facts and understand the impact on  our local candle manufacturers as a result of these dubious and unfair practices     Senator Clinton said           Syracuse used to be one of the world  s prime producers of candles  yet their market has steadily declined since the early 1980s    primarily due to Chinese trade practices   Since the Antidumping Duty Order was issued in 1986  widespread efforts to evade the policies set forth in the Order have tripled the number of imported Chinese candles that should be subject to the Antidumping Duty Order  based on their composition    Congress passed anti circumvention laws to protect the integrity of our antidumping laws   and when our antidumping laws have been violated  it is important to ensure a remedy is in place so our trade rules are not weakened             The International Trade Commission  ITC   in its Second Sunset Review of the Antidumping Duty Order issued in July 2005  concluded that the number of production and related workers in the U S  candle industry had declined by 13 5 percent between 1999 and 2004  In its review  the ITC also confirmed that the U S  industry is suffering injury as a result of these practices and determined that revocation of the antidumping duty order covering petroleum wax candles from China would likely lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury to an industry in the United States within a reasonably foreseeable time           Last year Senators Clinton and Schumer wrote a letter urging the Department of Commerce to take action and investigate allegations of the Chinese circumvention efforts while expressing great concern towards the potentially irreparable harm these efforts could cause on the U S  candle industry    most notably the candle production in and around Syracuse             A copy of the Senators   letter is attached          May 18  2006      The Honorable Carlos M  Gutierrez  Secretary of Commerce  United States Department of Commerce  14th Street and Constitution Avenue  NW  Washington  DC  20230      Dear Secretary Gutierrez       Last year  many of us wrote to you expressing our support for the Department of Commerce  s consideration of a petition related to the composition of Chinese candles  specifically whether Chinese candle producers and U S  importers are attempting to circumvent the 108 3 percent Antidumping Duty Order imposed on petroleum wax candles from China          It is our understanding that the Department is prepared to issue a determination by May 23  2006  on one or two of the petitions filed by the National Candle Association  NCA  in response to the Chinese circumvention   We urge you to proceed in accordance with the Department  s precedent with respect to later developed merchandise anti circumvention investigations   It concerns us that any change to the precedent would likely result in the weakening of U S  trade laws  thereby making it difficult for U S  companies to receive legitimate remedies under the statute          As you know  the Antidumping Duty Order on petroleum wax candles from the People  s Republic of China  PRC  was first issued in 1986   Since then    particularly during the last eight years   circumvention efforts by Chinese producers have more than tripled the number of imported candles that some erroneously allege are not subject to the Order   According to the NCA  the Chinese efforts include the importation of petroleum and palm vegetable blended wax candles  in which the palm or vegetable wax is purported to be the majority ingredient   If the Chinese continue to circumvent the Order  it will cause irreparable harm to these companies and to domestic candle producers in general          In our letter to you last year  we expressed our sincere concern that continued circumvention by the Chinese would cause irreparable harm to U S  candle producers   The International Trade Commission  ITC   in its Second Sunset Review of the Antidumping Duty Order issued in July 2005  agreed with our concerns   The ITC report confirmed that the U S  industry is suffering injury  and determined   that revocation of the antidumping duty order covering petroleum wax candles from China would likely lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury to an industry in the United States within a reasonably foreseeable time     In that decision  the ITC clarified the language of its original Determination  and made it clear that it had never intended to exclude mixed wax candles  meaning vegetable wax candles  from the Order  thereby removing the basis for a Determination that mixed wax candles are outside the scope of the Order          In its July 2005 Review  the ITC also concluded that the number of production and related workers in the U S  candle industry   declined by 13 5 percent between 1999 and 2004      Even our hard working and increasingly efficient American candle producers and employees cannot fairly compete with illegal dumping and circumvention by Chinese candle producers          As you know  the antidumping statute and the Department s regulations provide for anti circumvention proceedings to include later developed merchandise within the scope of the Order   These are the procedures that Congress intended to be used   According to the ITC  at the time of the original Candles decision  mixed wax candles comprised of more than 50 percent vegetable wax did not exist in the U S  market and did not become commercially available until the late 1990s and early 2000s  In the late 1990s and early 2000s  U S  companies and the Chinese developed new processes and formulas that enabled the production of candles made of 50 percent or more vegetable wax and petroleum wax that looks the same  smells the same  burns the same  performs the same  and is used for the same purposes as today s state of the art candles that are made of 100 percent petroleum wax  Consequently  the ITC in effect concluded that mixed wax candles must be considered later developed merchandise under the anti circumvention statute because they were not available in the marketplace in 1986 at the time of the original investigation          It is important to ensure hard working American candle producers and employees are able to trade on a level playing field   Therefore  we urge you to proceed in accordance with the Department  s precedent  and if it is found that the Order is being circumvented  we urge you to progress in accordance with the law          Sincerely       Tom Coburn  Blanche L  Lincoln  Mike DeWine
