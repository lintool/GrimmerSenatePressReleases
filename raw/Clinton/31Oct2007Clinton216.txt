October 24  2007   General T  Michael Moseley  Chief of Staff  1670 Air Force Pentagon  Room 4E562  Washington  DC 20330   Dear General Moseley    For months we have monitored efforts to address resourcing of aircraft which would enable the New Yorks Air National Guards  NYANGs  107th Air Refueling Wing to associate with the Air Force Reserves 914th Airlift Wing at Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station  NFARS    The 914th is also the host unit at the Base    Recently  General Officer representatives of the Air Staff  Air Force Reserve Command  and Air National Guard met with the Delegation with regards to its proposal to resource four C 130H2 aircraft to the NFARS from Nashville for the 914th and 107th to associate   The aircraft would be assigned to the Air Force Reserves under a Memorandum of Understanding which would place the four aircraft under the inventory and control of the Air Force Reserves   The agreement includes specific language regarding the use of the aircraft by the 107th and the ability of the Governor to task any of the 12 C 130 aircraft at NFARS in the event of a State emergency  utilizing aircrews from the 107th    Additionally  both the House and Senate versions of the Fiscal Year  FY  2008 National Defense Authorization Act contains a legislative provision requiring the Secretary to provide a report outlining the long range plans and aircraft resourcing for NFARS to the Committees on Armed Services by December 1  2007   The proposed assignment of the four aircraft from Nashville is a welcome start in beginning the process of returning NFARS to a 16 PAA   To enable the Department to be in a better position to leverage opportunities  such as the possibility that C 130 H model aircraft in Alaska may become available prior to FY 2011  we will urge the NDAA Conferees to extend the reporting deadline until March 1  2008 but will request that the required report make clear that the Air Force specify its plans to return t o a 16 PAA status for NFARS within the Future Years Defense Plan    Given that the AFRC proposed to close NFARS as part of their 2005 BRAC submission  we  along with the State and the Adjutant General  TAG  of NY  have raised concerns that if the incoming aircraft are not designated NYANG assets  the future viability of the 107th would be open to question if the 914th to be re located at some point in the future   However  we will not oppose proceeding with the current proposal to associate the 107th with the 914th lines as long as the Air Force commits to the following guidelines    Given that this issue has labored on for over 18 months and that there is a strong desire by the Department and the Delegation to bring this matter to a successful conclusion for both NFARS and Nashville  we urge you to provide a response as soon as possible   Further  given that Conference negotiations are proceeding  we will begin the process of contacting the Conferees to secure the extension on the Air Forces reporting requirement along with the clarification on the aircraft requirement for NFARS    We look forward to your prompt reply and appreciate your leadership on this matter    Sincerely
