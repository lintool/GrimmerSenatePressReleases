                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Bipartisan Bill Enacts Key Recommendation of Commission on Care for America s Returning Wounded Warriors Click here to listen to the Senators  press conference    Washington  DC  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   Elizabeth Dole  R NC   Barbara Mikulski  D MD   Lindsey Graham  R SC   Edward Kennedy  D MA  and Sherrod Brown  D OH  today introduced legislation to extend the Family and Medical Leave Act  FMLA  for up to six months for spouses and parents of soldiers who have been injured in combat   The bipartisan bill enacts a key recommendation of the Commission on Care for Americas Returning Wounded Warriors    It is our responsibility to make sure our wounded soldiers receive the care and support they need   It is also our duty to recognize and help address the extraordinary challenges their loved ones will face as they struggle to serve as their caregivers   This is the right thing to do for our military families  said Senator Clinton     Our men and women in uniform risk their lives to defend our freedoms and keep our nation safe  said Senator Dole   When service members are injured while answering the call of duty  they deserve to have their loved ones comfort and support   This bill will ensure that spouses  parents  sons and daughters of wounded soldiers can take time to care for them without fear of losing their jobs and livelihoods   This is the right thing to do for our military families    Our military men and women make great sacrifices and honor their country by volunteering to serve   Their families share the burden of this war   We must recognize and honor their service and sacrifice  not just with words  but with deeds  said Senator Mikulski   Thats why Im fighting for the spouses and children of our true American heroes to have extended leave from their jobs when their loved ones are injured fighting a war for America  because service members and their families have enough to worry about    This bill is an opportunity for us to help the families of our wounded soldiers  said Senator Graham   Military families are the unsung heroes of this war   Its only fitting we provide them with the help and assistance they need   Im proud to be part of this effort    The Military Family and Medical Leave Act will give substantial additional leave for family members to care for wounded servicemen and women   Such leave was one of then Walter Reed Commissions key recommendations  and prompt action is necessary  since more and more of our troops are being wounded every day in Iraq and Afghanistan  So far  over 27 000 have been wounded in Iraq alone   These wounded warriors have made enormous sacrifices for our country   Their family members bring support  comfort  and assistance that no one else can and they deserve additional time off from their jobs in order to provide it   Id strongly support making this leave paid leave  Senator Kennedy said    A family should never be forced to choose between caring for a loved one and keeping a job   Many military families are already financially strapped because of this war   This bill would ensure that our soldiers receive the care and support that only a family can provide  said Senator Brown  a member of the Veterans Affairs Committee    In its review  the Commission found that 33 percent of active duty  22 percent of reserve component  and 37 percent of retired separated service members report that a family member or close friend relocated for extended periods of time to be with them while they were in the hospital   In addition  21 percent of active duty  15 percent of reserve component  and 24 percent of retired separated service members say friends or family gave up a job to be with them or act as their caregiver   To address this situation and help support these caregivers  the Commission recommended strengthening family support programs by extending the Family and Medical Leave Act  FMLA  for up to six months for spouses and parents of seriously injured soldiers    The Military Family and Medical Leave Act will enact this recommendation   The bill will amend the Family and Medical Leave Act to allow up to six months leave within a single year for a family member of a service member who has a combat related injury and meets the eligibility requirements in the law     The Commission on Care for Americas Returning Wounded Warriors was established in March 2007 with the specific goals of conducting a comprehensive review of services the government currently provides to our wounded warriors and delivering recommendations to the President  Secretary of Defense and Secretary of Veterans Affairs
