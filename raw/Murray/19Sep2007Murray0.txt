                                          News Release          Murray Speaks Out to Give Troops More Time at Home As co sponsor of bi partisan amendment to provide service members with as much time at home as they spend on duty  Murray urges Senate passage    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  September 19  2007     Murray s Speech  Washington  D C    Today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D WA  spoke on the Senate floor in favor of a bi partisan amendment to the Department of Defense  DoD  Authorization bill that would provide service members with more time at home with their families  The amendment would also increase our military readiness  and our ability to respond to disasters at home  The amendment was offered by Senators Jim Webb  D VA  and Chuck Hagel  R NE    We hear lots of rhetoric on this floor about supporting our troops  but I believe that this amendment is an opportunity to end the rhetoric and start with action  Murray said in her speech  Troops should be at home for the same amount of time as they are deployed  This seems like basic  common sense requirement  We have to institute a fair policy for the health of our troops  for the health and well being of their families  and for our nation s security and ability to respond to disasters here at home   The amendment mandates minimum dwell time for both active duty and Reserve service members  The amendment states that if a unit or a member of a regular component of the Armed Forces deploys to Iraq or Afghanistan  when their deployment ends they will have at least the same time at home as they spent on duty before they are redeployed  The amendment also specifies that no unit or member of a Reserve component  including the National Guard  could be redeployed to Iraq or Afghanistan within three years of their previous deployment  The amendment includes a provision that allows the President to waive these requirements if the deployment is necessary to meet an emergency   on the amendment Senator Murray s full remarks follow  Mr  President  more than four years into the war in Iraq  our troops are stretched thin  our equipment is deteriorating  and the patience of our nation is wearing out  We have seen 3 700 service members die  Thousands upon thousands more have been injured  And month after month  our fighting men and women are pushing harder and harder  Troops leave loved ones for months and years  and put their lives on the line without complaint  We owe them the best treatment and training possible  Unfortunately  the Bush Administration has fallen short in these areas  Mr  President  our country is home to some of the finest fighting forces in the world  and we can all be proud of that  We need our military to remain the best trained  best equipped  and most prepared force in the world  Tragically  however  the President s War in Iraq and his use of extended deployments is undermining our military s readiness  The current deployment schedule hampers our ability to respond to threats around the world   It causes service members to leave military service early  It weakens our ability to respond to disasters here at home  It unfairly burdens family members  and intensifies the combat stress that our service members experience   We need to rebuild our military  and the first step is giving our fighting men and women the time they need here at home to prepare and train for their next mission  Today I rise to address the readiness challenges that threaten our military s strength and ultimately our nation s security  Mr  President  two months ago I came to this floor and spoke those very same words in my effort to support the Webb amendment  virtually the same measure we are now considering today  Member after member did the same  pleading with our colleagues to join us in this most basic effort to truly support the troops  Unfortunately  even though 56 senators voted in favor of the measure  it was blocked by Republican senators  Since then  more of our troops have died  More have been wounded  And more have been subjected to 15 month deployments without hope for the same amount of time at home  Meanwhile  the Administration has told us that 15 month deployments will continue and they have maintained their plan to keep 130 000 troops in Iraq  Well  today we have another chance  Another chance to support our troops  to support their families  and to return some common sense to our troop rotations  We need 3 more courageous Republican senators to join us  I hope that they will  Burning Out Forces  Sadly  Mr  President  our forces are being burned out  Many of our troops are on their third or even fourth tours in Iraq and Afghanistan  Months ago  the Department of Defense announced that tours would be extended from 12 to 15 months  And on top of all that  they are not receiving the necessary time at home before they are sent back to battle  Mr  President  that is not the normal schedule  It is not what our troops signed up for  And we here in Congress should not simply stand by and allow our troops to be pushed beyond their limits like this  Typical Rotation Schedule Mr  President  traditionally active duty troops are deployed for one year and then rest at home for two years  National Guard and Reserve troops are deployed for one year and then rest at home for five years  But that is certainly not the case now  Currently  active duty troops are spending less time at home than they are in battle  And Guard and Reserve forces are receiving less than three years rest for every year in combat  With the increasing number and length of deployments  this rest time is even more critical for our troops  Unfortunately  our forces are not receiving the break they need  increasing the chance they ll become burnt out  But this Administration has decided to go the other direction  pushing our troops harder  extending their time abroad  and sending troops back time and again to the battlefield  Responding to Other Global Threats The current rotation policy not only burns out service members  but it hurts the military s ability to respond to other potential threats  For the first time in decades  the Army s ready brigade  that is intended to enter trouble spots within 72 hours  cannot do so  All of its troops are in Iraq and Afghanistan  The limited period between deployments also lessens the time to train for other threats  Numerous military leaders have spoken to us about this problem    General James Conway said I think my largest concern  probably  has to do with training  When we re home for that seven  eight  nine months  our focus is going back to Iraq  And as I mentioned in the opening statement  therefore  we re not doing amphibious training  we re not doing mountain warfare training  we re not doing combined arm fire maneuver  such as would need to be the case  potentially  in another type of contingency   General Conway  Senate Armed Services Committee  2 15 07  That s not me  Mr  President  That is General James Conway before the Senate Armed Services Committee in February of this year  And General Barry McCaffrey said that because all fully combat ready active duty and reserve combat units are now deployed in Iraq or Afghanistan  no fully trained national strategic reserve brigades are now prepared to deploy to new combat operations   General McCaffrey  Senate Committee on Armed Services  4 17 07  Responding to Disasters Here at Home Third  the deployment schedule is making us less secure here at home  The current rotation policy has left Guard units short of man power and supplies  and severely hindered their ability to respond to disasters here at home  For years  these problems were the exception  not the rule  But I fear that balance is shifting  Recently  USA Today reported that National Guard units in 31 states say four years of war in Iraq and Afghanistan have left them with 60  or less of their authorized equipment  And last month  Lt  General H  Steven Blum said National Guard units have 53 percent of the equipment they need to handle state emergencies  and that number falls to 49 percent once Guard equipment needed for war such as weapons is factored in  In fact  Blum said  and I quote  Our problem right now is that our equipment is at an all time low  Mr  President  this is deeply concerning to all of us who worry about a national disaster in our states  in the West where we face forest fires  along the Gulf Coast where we have already seen the destruction of hurricanes this season  and in the Midwest where entire downs can be decimated by tornadoes in minutes  Families  But Mr  President  this problem is about more than equipment  It s about more than retention rates  It is about real people and about real families  We all know that military life can be tough on troops and their families  They go months and sometimes years without seeing each other  Our troops need adequate time at home to see their newborns  to be a part of their children s lives  to spend time with their husbands or wives  and to see their parents  The current rotation policy decreases the time families are together  placing a great strain on everyone  Our troops  facing these early deployments and extended tours  have spoken out  When the tour extensions and early deployments were announced  our troops themselves expressed their displeasure  In Georgia  according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution  Soldiers of a Georgia Army National Guard unit were hoping to return home in April but instead  they may be spending another grueling summer in the Iraqi desert  At least 4 000 National Guard soldiers may spend up to four extra months in Iraq as part of President Bush s troop increase announced last month  Sgt  Gary Heffner  a spokesman for the 214th  said news of the extension came as a little bit of a shock to the Georgians   Atlanta Journal Constitution  2 7 07  In the 1ST Cavalry Division  according to the Dallas Morning News  Eighteen months after their first Iraq rotation  the 2nd Battalion  5th Cavalry Regiment and the last of the Fort Hood  Texas based 1st Cavalry Division returned to Iraq in mid November  And  Mr  President  these are the words of Brandon Jones  a veteran from my home state of Washington who testified before my field hearing on mental health care in Tacoma in August   In November 2003  I was called to full time duty with the 81st Brigade  I was given a very short notice that my unit was being mobilized  In that time I had to give up my civilian job   an income loss of about  1 200 a month  and my wife had to drop out of classes at Olympic College to care for our children  I went from living at home and seeing my children on a daily basis to living on base   just one mile from home   and visiting my children periodically  To my kids  I went from being their dad to the guy who drops by the house for a visit once in a while  The three months of mobilization before my deployment were very stressful  We struggled financially  Although we reached out for help  we were told that the only financial resources available were strictly for active duty soldiers at Fort Lewis  It wasn t until we were threatened with eviction and repossession of our car that my wife was able to obtain a small amount of assistance generally reserved for Active Duty Soldiers  Our families helped us make up the rest  About 60 percent of what we were in need of  The stress made it difficult for my wife to keep a positive attitude  for our children to feel comfortable and for me to concentrate on the mission ahead of me  When my wife and I reached out for marriage counseling prior to my deployment  we were made to feel that the few sessions we were given were a favor to us and that we were taking up a resource meant for active duty Soldiers from the base  Let me remind you that all of this happened before I was even deployed   Mr  President  as Brandon said  that was before he was even deployed  Just imagine what a family goes through during those 15 month deployments  Webb Amendment So Mr  President  it is clear that we need to pass the Webb Amendment  We hear lots of rhetoric on this floor about supporting our troops  but I believe that this amendment is an opportunity to end the rhetoric and start with action  Troops should be at home for the same amount of time as they are deployed  This seems like basic  common sense requirement  I applaud our colleague from Virginia for being a champion for our troops  and for crafting this bi partisan measure that he  and the entire Senate  can be proud of  Our troops have sacrificed so much  They have already gone above and beyond the call of duty  We have to institute a fair policy for the health of our troops  for the health and well being of their families  and for our nation s security and ability to respond to disasters here at home  This amendment does all these things  and I urge the Senate to support it
