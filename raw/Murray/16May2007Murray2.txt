                                                                               News Release          IRAQ   Murray Works to Redeploy Troops  Target Al Qaeda  and Rebuild America s Military With Major Speech and Vote for Feingold Reid Amendment  Murray Shows Urgency of Changing Course in Iraq and Making America More Secure    For Immediate Release  Wednesday  May 16  2007          Washington  D C     In a major speech on the Senate floor today  U S  Senator Patty Murray  D Wash  called for new priorities to protect America including redeploying troops from Iraq s civil war  targeting Al Qaeda terrorists around the globe  and rebuilding America s military           In Iraq  our troops have done everything we ve asked them to do  and now it s time to begin redeploying our troops  rebuilding our military  and getting back to fighting the broader war on terror   Murray said    Leaving our troops in the middle of a civil war in Iraq is not the best use of our military  does not make us safer at home  diminishes our ability to fight the broader war on terror  and impairs our military s readiness       Also today  Murray voted for the Feingold Reid Amendment which called for American troops to be safely redeployed from Iraq by March 31  2008   The amendment would have allowed some American troops to remain in Iraq to fight Al Qaeda  secure American interests  and train and equip Iraqi security forces       Redeploy from Iraq     The Iraqi civil war cannot be solved militarily   It must be solved politically   Today we are five years into this war   Thousands of American lives have been lost  and billions of U S  taxpayer dollars have been spent   The Iraqis have yet to move forward with meeting key benchmarks and beginning reconciliation   We have to show the Iraqis that we will not police their civil war indefinitely  and that they must take responsibility for their own future   Murray said       Strengthen Readiness   In discussing readiness  Murray quoted from military leaders who have detailed problems with destroyed equipment  limited training  and low readiness of non deployed Guard and Reserve forces           We can all be proud that our country is home to the finest fighting force in the world   But we must also face the truth  the war in Iraq has impaired our military s readiness   That s not my opinion  It s the opinion of military leaders and experts  who say it may take 5 years to rebuild our military  The Iraq War has impaired our readiness by forcing a hard to maintain tempo on our troops  destroying our equipment  reducing the capabilities of our Guard and Reserve  and limiting the training our troops receive   Murray said       Murray also noted that a lack of readiness is hurting disaster response and homeland security missions at home       Refocus on Al Qaeda    Murray said that America must refocus its efforts stopping the Al Qaeda network around the world         This Administration s focus on Iraq has distracted us from the larger War on Terror and left us vulnerable        Lack of Security at Home     I m very concerned that the Bush Administration has chosen to fund this war in ways that have meant that homeland security priorities have not been fully funded   Murray said  detailing a list of cuts the President has sought to first responders  state homeland security grants  and other domestic security programs        Finally  Senator Murray discussed the need to care for service members  veterans and their families       Senator Murray s full remarks follow     Mr  President  in these dangerous times  we face threats from terrorists around the world   The decisions we make here in the United States Senate must put us in a stronger position to fight and defeat terrorists wherever they hide   Last week  the U S  and German governments unraveled a reported plot to attack American interests in Germany   This development reminds us that we face dangers all around the globe  and we need to be able to dispatch our resources wherever and whenever they are needed to keep us safe         Unfortunately  having nearly 150 000 American troops stuck in the middle of a civil war in Iraq does not strengthen our ability to fight terrorists around the world   In fact  by forcing our troops to police a civil war and by not giving our troops with the equipment and training they need  the President s policy is impairing our military readiness and our ability to fight and win the broader war on terror        It is time to re focus our efforts back onto the broader war on terror  Yes  we will still fight and defeat the Al Qaeda terrorists who are in Iraq   But we recognize that terror networks exist in many other countries  and we have to fight and defeat terrorists in those other places as well        That s why I support the Feingold Reid Amendment  The amendment recognizes that leaving our troops in the middle of a civil war in Iraq          is not the best use of our military        does not make us safer at home        diminishes our ability to fight the broader war on terror        and impairs our military s readiness        Mr  President  it is clear the Iraqi civil war cannot be solved militarily   It must be solved politically   Today we are five years into this war   Thousands of American lives have been lost  and billions of U S  taxpayer dollars have been spent          The Iraqis have yet to move forward with meeting key benchmarks and beginning reconciliation         We have to show the Iraqis that we will not police their civil war indefinitely  and that they must take responsibility for their own future          The redeployment language in the Feingold Reid amendment makes it clear to the Iraqis that our commitment is not open ended and that they must make the necessary compromises to bring peace to their country   In Iraq  our troops have done everything we ve asked them to do  and now it s time to begin redeploying our troops  rebuilding our military and getting back to fighting the broader war on terror          As I look at these issues  I see four imperatives          First we ve got to fight and defeat terrorists        Second  we ve got to recognize that the war in Iraq is impacting our ability to do that        Third  we ve got to rebuild our military readiness  which has been seriously compromised by the war in Iraq         And finally  we must be there to support our service members  our veterans and their families every step of the way       1  We Must Fight and Defeat Terrorists    First  we all recognize that we are in a war with terrorists around the world  and we need to fight and win that war   This is not a war against countries   We are in a war against terrorists wherever they reside        President Bush wants us to believe that the war in Iraq is the war on terror   It is not   The war on terror that our country faces is not the same thing as the civil war that s raging in Iraq   What s happening in Iraq is primarily a civil war between factions who have been in conflict for generations          The Feingold Reid amendment empowers our military to target and destroy any terrorist elements in Iraq   But it would not force the majority of American troops to be stuck indefinitely in the crossfire of a civil war          As we look at the terror threats our nation confronts  Al Qaeda is the most dangerous according to the  from last year   The N I E  said  quote          Al Qa ida will continue to pose the greatest threat to the Homeland and US interests abroad by a single terrorist organization        The N I E  also says that jihadists              are increasing in both number and geographic dispersion   If this trend continues  threats to US interests at home and abroad will become more diverse  leading to increasing attacks worldwide       Mr  President  Al Qaeda is the threat  We ve got to get back to fighting Al Qaeda  and this amendment does just that          Under the Feingold Reid Amendment  while most troops would be redeployed  some would remain to         conduct targeted operations against al Qaeda and other terror groups        provide security for American infrastructure and personnel        and train and equip the Iraqi security forces        Mr  President  this Administration s focus on Iraq has distracted us from the larger War on Terror and left us vulnerable  Our country faces possible threats from terrorists around the world  and we need a security strategy that ensures we can fight those threats wherever they are  But instead  the Bush Administration has become increasingly focused on Iraq  which weakens our ability to fight the broader War on Terror just when we must be strong         2  The Civil War in Iraq is Not Making Us More Secure    Next  Mr  President  let s look at the relationship between the civil war in Iraq and our own security   Does having so much of our military tied up in Iraq s civil war make us safer  Does it help us fight terrorists around the world  The truth is that leaving our troops in Iraq is not making us more secure   A State Department report from two weeks ago found         International intervention in Iraq    has been used by terrorists as a rallying cry for radicalization and extremist activity that has contributed to instability in neighboring countries        U S  Department of State  Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism      April 30  2007          So according to our own State Department  our involvement in Iraq is making the region less stable   not more stable        The war in Iraq has the potential to make it harder for us to respond to other threats around the world   That s because the conflict in Iraq is tying up large parts of our military and is degrading our military readiness       3  We Need to Rebuild Our Military    Which brings me to my third point    Mr  President  we must rebuild America s military        We can all be proud that our country is home to the finest fighting force in the world   But we must also face the truth  the war in Iraq has impaired our military s readiness   That s not my opinion  It s the opinion of military leaders and experts  who say it may take 5 years to rebuild our military         The Iraq War has impaired our readiness by          forcing a hard to maintain tempo on our troops        destroying our equipment        reducing the capabilities of our Guard and Reserve        and limiting the training our troops receive       Readiness   Troops    Today  we are forcing a very tough tempo on our service members   They all want to work  and they all want to work hard  But we have to make sure that the demands placed on them are reasonable   The Pentagon has extended tours of duties for troops  It has deployed troops sooner than planned  It has sent troops without all the training and equipment they could have received   It s deployed troops without the down time at home that our service members and their families deserve   Two Army brigades are on their fourth deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan   This tremendous pace    with little down time in between    is a strain on our troops         Mr  President  our military is the best in the world  I believe we need to address the strains on our service members  so we can remain the best in the world       Readiness   Equipment    The Iraq War is also impairing our readiness by destroying our equipment   For example  the Army is supposed to have five brigades  worth of equipment pre positioned overseas   But because of the war in Iraq  the Army is depleting those reserves          General Peter Schoomaker told the Senate last month   It will take us two years to rebuild those stocks    Testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee  3 15 07        Mr  President  our military is the best in the world  I believe we need to address the strains on equipment  so we can remain the best in the world       Readiness   National Guard    Mr  President  the Iraq War has especially impacted the readiness of our National Guard   The chief of the National Guard Bureau  Lt  General Stephen Blum  testified that the readiness of National Guard forces is at an historic low  General Blum said that   Eighty eight percent of the forces that are back here in the United States are very poorly equipped today in the Army National Guard     on the National Guard and Reserve  1 31 07  page 9            A national commission looked at the National Guard and Reserve and sent its report to us in Congress in March   The Commission said   We believe that the current posture and utilization of the National Guard and Reserve as an  operational reserve  is not sustainable over time  and if not corrected with significant changes to law and policy  the reserve component s ability to serve our nation will diminish     Commission on the National Guard and Reserves     March 1  2007  Executive Summary         Mr  President  our military is the best in the world  I believe we need to address the readiness of our Guard and Reserve  so we can remain the best in the world       Readiness of Guard   Reserve Affects Domestic Disaster Preparation    Mr  President  we also rely on our Guard members when disasters strike here at home   We need their trained personnel and equipment to respond quickly         After the horrible tornados in Kansas two weeks ago  the Governor of Kansas said that recovery efforts were hampered because there weren t enough personnel or equipment  Those resources were in Iraq  not here at home         Colonel Timothy Orr of the U S  Army National Guard told the Senate that his brigade s homeland security capabilities have been degraded    He testified          Our ability as a brigade to perform these  homeland  missions continues to be degraded by continued equipment shortages  substitutions  and the cross leveling of equipment between the state and nation to support our deploying units    Testimony before Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support  4 24 07       Readiness   Training    Mr  President  I ve shown how the Iraq War has impacted the readiness of our troops  our equipment  and our National Guard   The pace of deployment to Iraq is also hindering another measure of readiness   the training our service members receive        To meet the President s surge  the Pentagon has been sending some troops to Iraq earlier than planned and keeping other units there longer than planned   That means that troops are get less time at home  less time between deployments  and less time to train   Commanders are forced to shorten the training their troops receive  so they re focusing on the specific training they need for Iraq   but not for other potential conflicts   Now that makes sense   If there s limited training time  we want all that time devoted to their most immediate need    However  many military leaders are warning that this fast pace diminishes our ability to respond to other potential conflicts        Here s how the Colonel who commands the 1st Marine Regime put it   Our greatest challenge is and will remain available training time  and because that time is limited  our training will continue to focus on the specific mission in Iraq  This has  and will continue to  limit our ability to train for other operations    Colonel Lewis Craparotta  U S  Marine Corps  Commander  1st Marine Regiment  Testimony before Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support  4 24 07        Army Colonel Michael Beech told the Senate in April that he believes our training strategy is broad enough to support a variety of other events   But he added   However  if deployed in support of other emerging contingencies  I would be concerned with the atrophy of some specific tactical skills unique to the higher intensity conflicts    Testimony before Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support  4 24 07        So we have military commanders telling us that they re concerned that our ability to train for other missions has been limited and certain tactical skills have atrophied          Mr  President  we don t know what the future will bring   We don t know what types of conflicts we ll need to be prepared to fight   It s our responsibility as leaders today to be preparing for whatever the future brings   By allowing our troops to only be trained for today s mission  we are not meeting our responsibility for the long term dangers our country must be prepared to defeat         Mr  President  our military is the best in the world  I believe we need to address these training shortfalls  so we can remain the best in the world       Security at Home    I m also concerned that the billions of dollars we re spending in Iraq are coming at the expense of our ability to be strong here at home   I m very concerned that the Bush Administration has chosen to fund this war in ways that have meant that homeland security priorities have not been fully funded         I ve worked to correct that in areas like port security grants and first responder funding  But it s not easy to overcome years of misplaced priorities from the Bush Administration         Let me share a few examples from the President s latest budget proposal          President Bush dramatically cut critical funding for first responders in his FY08 budget to pay for the war in Iraq         Bush s budget cut critical state homeland security grants by  348 million  or about 60 percent         He reduced urban area grants by  185 million  or about 25 percent         He cut Local Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Grants by  119 million  or about 33 percent         Funds are limited  so we ve got to be smart  and policing a civil war in Iraq should not come at the expense of security here at home       4  We Need to Be There for Service Members  Veterans and Families    Finally  Mr  President  as we fight and win the war on terror and rebuild our military  we need to be there to support our service members  veterans and their families          We need to meet their needs every step of the way from the day they re recruited  while they re trained  when they re deployed  and as they transition back home   Today  too many service members are falling through the cracks and not getting the support they deserve   That s why I m working on the Veterans  Affairs and Appropriations Committees to identify and meet those needs   At the end of the day  our security comes down to people   people doing a job our country asks them to do   and we need to keep our promise to them       Conclusion    Mr  President  we face terror threats around the world  and we must   and we will   defeat them   To do so  we must be smart and tough   Unfortunately  the civil war in Iraq is not making us more secure  It s making us less secure  We need to refocus our fight back to the war on terror  and we need to rebuild our military   I support the Feingold Reid amendment because it sets a new direction for our involvement in Iraq so that we can focus on the larger security challenges our country faces   Mr  President  this is what I m fighting for in the United States Senate  and I know we can do it  We can take care of our men and women in uniform  We can improve security here at home   We can track down and eliminate terrorists around the world  It s just a matter of getting our priorities straight   Redeploying our troops from Iraq so we can focus on those other priorities is a critical first step that the Senate must take
