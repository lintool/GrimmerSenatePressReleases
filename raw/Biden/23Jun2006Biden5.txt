             June 23, 2006 
 Dover, DE -- U.S. Senators Joe Biden (D-DE) and Tom Carper (D-DE) and Congressman Mike Castle (R-DE) today announced that the Department of Veterans Affairs will open a new community-based, outpatient health care clinic for veterans living in the Dover area.   Right now, veterans living in Kent County must travel to the VA facility in Wilmington or the clinic in Millsboro for medical care, said the delegation. As our veteran population expands with the addition of men and women whove served in Iraq, it is even more important that we make quality medical care convenient and accessible. This facility, located in the middle of the state, will go a long way toward that end.   More than 15,000 veterans reside in Kent County, of which about 1500-1700 are expected to use this facility.     The clinic will provide primary and mental health care and is expected to begin serving patients within the coming year. A specific location in Dover has yet to be determined.
