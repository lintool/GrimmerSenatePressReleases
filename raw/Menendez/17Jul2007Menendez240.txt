ON CHANGING COURSE IN IRAQ DURING MARATHON SENATE DEBATE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Tuesday  July 17  2007       WASHINGTON  During the marathon  over night Senate debate of legislation to bring American troops home  U S  Senator Robert Menendez  D NJ  made the following speech  Madam President  I rise in strong support of the Levin Reed amendment  That is the amendment that  unlike the Iraq Study Group  has a date certain for changing and transitioning our mission and bringing our troops home  Maybe if the Senate had listened to the Iraq Study Group last year when it presented its report and had adopted it and moved in that direction  we would not be where we are today  I personally believe it is well past time to now suggest that it is appropriate to adopt their recommendations when what we need is a date certain   We are here tonight to ask for a vote  not just any vote  We are here to ask for a fundamental American principle  a majority vote for majority rule  Not a supermajority vote of 60 votes  A majority vote for majority rule  the same principle that has stood over the test of time in our country  the same principle that average Americans fully understand  the same principle that would reflect the reality of where the American public is as it relates to this critical issue  A majority vote for a majority rule  Not just any vote   We are here tonight because the American people deserve is an up or down vote on this important amendment that will finally bring an end to this mismanaged war  The war in Iraq  in my mind  is the most pressing issue of our day  and the fact that the Republican leadership and those who join them will not allow the Senate to have a straight up or down vote  a simple majority vote  speaks of obstructionism and of hiding behind procedural roadblocks in order to avoid facing the American people who have called for a change of course in Iraq   Those of us who voted against the war  as I did in the first place  against popular opinion of the time  have been vindicated by history  I say to my colleagues  history will judge the votes we cast tomorrow  and I believe those who vote against a simple majority rule and changing the course will be judged harshly   The President has lost the support of the American public and the confidence of the global community  The only support for his misguided policy in Iraq is a minority in the Senate  That is why they are afraid of a simple up or down vote on this issue because given in this body a simple majority vote proposition  a majority of the Senate would vote to transition us out of Iraq and bring our men and women home  That is why they are afraid of the vote that we ask for   Unfortunately  some  and I say some because I know some of our Republican colleagues have joined us in the past and will again  some of my Republican colleagues seem more interested in protecting the President than doing right  in my mind  by our troops  To the Republican leadership and those who support them  I say it is time to stop filibustering and time to start a vote  a simple majority vote for majority rule   Maybe if more of the sons and daughters  husbands and wives  or sisters and brothers of Members of the Senate were in Iraq  some of my colleagues would not be so cavalier about filibustering an up or down  simple majority vote  If our loved ones were in Iraq  who among us would be content with the counsel of patience and delay  Who among us would be satisfied with another mission accomplished  Who among us would be satisfied with victory is around the next corner  Who among us would be satisfied with benchmarks of which not one  not one  has been accomplished  and yet we somehow suggest that is progress years later   After four years of a failed policy  it is time to stop hiding behind procedural hurdles and allow the Senate to cast a definitive vote about our future course in Iraq  A majority vote for majority rule   The American people are waiting impatiently for the Senate to heed their calls and face the facts on the ground  It is time for a responsible change of course in Iraq  And that is exactly what the amendment on which we want a simple majority vote does  Let s see how people vote  a simple majority vote  The Levin  Reed amendment says our forces should be out of Iraq by April 30 of next year  except those needed to protect U S  personnel  to train Iraqi security forces and for counter terrorism activities   Last week  the House of Representatives passed very similar legislation  sending a clear message that the time for change has come  The only obstacle left is for this body to act with a simple majority vote   Now the Senate  once again  faces a critical vote on Iraq  and I point out  as I did a few days ago when we debated an amendment to take care of our troops  We hear all the time about support the troops  yet we had to have a supermajority vote to simply permit the rotation of our troops to be able to have a year back at home for every year they served abroad  a proposition that even the Defense Department has as its goal  But  we couldn t have a simple majority vote on that issue  we had to have a 60 vote threshold  Support the troops   The only way we could have done that was with bipartisan support  and we didn t get it  The only way we can stop this war is with bipartisan support  But so long as we keep having these 60 vote thresholds  Democrats have 51 votes in this body and that leaves us 9 votes short  The American people know that  That is why we want a simple majority vote for majority rule   Despite overwhelming public support    the public is way ahead of this institution  the American people are way ahead of this institution    and growing support from some of our Republican colleagues  which I respect  Democrats do not have the 60 votes needed to stop a filibuster in the Senate   I know that many more of our Republican colleagues have serious concerns about the war in Iraq  I have been reading about it  I have been reading in the local and national papers of so many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle saying  We have grave reservations about where the President is continuing to take us  We believe we have to have some type of change  I urge them to listen to their inner voice  I urge them to find their moral compass  I urge them to back their strong words with meaningful votes   A vote for Levin Reed  a simple up or down vote  is a vote to transition out of Iraq  a vote to change the course  a vote to end the war   Robert Kennedy said about the war in Vietnam   Past error is no excuse for its own perpetuation  Tragedy is a tool for the living to gain wisdom  not a guide by which to live   Past error is no excuse for its own perpetuation  He went on to say   All men make mistakes  but a good man     And I would paraphrase in today s terms  a good woman   yields when  they  know  their  cost is wrong  and repairs the evil   The only sin   The only sin   is pride   This is not an issue where we can afford for the sin of pride to deviate us  from taking us into the appropriate course  to change the course in Iraq   The lessons of history are poignant and instructive about today s quagmire  Rather than hiding behind a shrinking minority and procedural posturing  Republicans should listen to the American people and change the course of this failed war policy  They should stand with the American people and tell the President  even though we have given him opportunities  even though previous efforts of the Senate have given him flexibility  he has outright rejected it and  so  yes  there must be a date certain  and the message to the President by this body is if you are not going to bring our troops home  then we will   I have heard many of my colleagues claim that what is happening now on the Senate floor is nothing more than political theater  The war in Iraq is the single greatest issue before the country and before this Senate  How many lives  how much money  how much risk to our security by being bogged down in Iraq can we afford  when we have real challenges in the world such as Iran  when we have a reconstituted al Qaeda in Afghanistan  that is the real challenge  That is the real challenge  I say to my friends  This is not about political theater  If there is political theater here  it is the sad  sad plot that the Republican leadership has weaved in creating this procedural hurdle to not permit a simple majority vote for majority rule   I heard my distinguished colleague from Connecticut  for whom I have enormous respect  lament the proceedings as partisan  I have the deepest respect for him  but I couldn t more passionately disagree with him  This isn t about partisanship  These are deeply held views of principle  principle that moves us to take these extraordinary measures so we can get a simple majority vote for majority rule  That is what we are simply seeking tonight   So to the Republican leadership and those who support them  I say it is time to stop filibustering and time to permit a simple majority vote to allow us to change the course in Iraq   Today we are living with the consequences of the administration s failed policy  and only a minority of the Senate wants to stay that failed course  Over 3 600 troops have been killed in Iraq since the beginning of the war  including 87 service members with ties to my home state of New Jersey  April and May was the deadliest 2 month period of the war for U S  troops  with 230 service members killed   We have now spent over  450 billion on the war in Iraq  with a burn rate of  10 billion a month  Frankly  I never believed the administration s estimates that the so called surge would only cost  5 6 billion  We have been misled time and time again  and these new numbers only prove once again we have been misled   Each day we read horrific stories about the violence and tragedy on the streets of Iraq  This week officials report that dozens of Shiites were massacred by Sunni extremists during an overnight raid in Diyala Province  Yesterday  suicide car bombs in Kirkuk killed more than 80 people and injured some 150 others  It was the deadliest attack the city had seen since the beginning of the war  In fact  suicide attacks have more than doubled across Iraq from 26 in January to 58 in April   In terms of reconstruction  based on measurements we all previously swore to be listening to  we see that oil production in Iraq is still lower than it was before the war  and Baghdad is getting less than 6 hours of electricity a day  significantly less than before the war   That is why we must proceed with a vote on the Levin Reed amendment and bring an end to our military involvement in Iraq which has cost our country so dearly in human lives and national treasure   Even all of the military personnel tell us we cannot have a military victory in Iraq  When I listen to General Pace say we need the Iraqis to love their children more than they hate their neighbors  it is probably a powerful truism  but it will not come through the power of military might  It is about reconciliation  confidence building measures  revenue sharing  and participation of all Iraqi society in the Government  It does not come through the barrel of a gun to have the Iraqis love their children more than they hate their enemies   So to the Republican leadership and those who support them  it is time to stop filibustering and time to permit us a simple majority vote for majority rule   Let me take a minute to discuss the administration s recent report on benchmarks in Iraq which President Bush is using as a justification for the United States to stay in Iraq   Just as some were misled into the war  I think this report is misleading  I wish to make sure everyone understands exactly what it says because I have listened to the debate and  boy  has it been mischaracterized  as far as I am concerned  I am sure not intentionally    because people read the document different ways  Let me tell what it clearly says to me   The report did not say that eight of the benchmarks had been met  Instead  the report said that satisfactory progress  a very significant distinction  has been made on only 8 of 18 benchmarks in Iraq  while the rest have not even seen  not even seen  satisfactory progress   In simple terms  none of the benchmarks were met   Let s make it clear  None of the benchmarks were met  And when this report came out  President Bush said   Those who believe that the battle in Iraq is lost will likely point to the unsatisfactory performance on some of the political benchmarks  Those of us who believe that the battle in Iraq can and must be won see the satisfactory performance on several of the security benchmarks as a cause for optimism   I want to reiterate to the President the fact that none of the benchmarks were actually met  None   Now  let me be clear  The absolute best version of the story is that the Iraqis made some progress on some of the benchmarks  That is it  But the fact is  zero out of 18 benchmarks were met  and this is after years  And  this is after changing the goalposts so that we can continue to suggest that we are making progress  If we kept the goalposts where they were supposed to be  we would have an even greater rate of failure   So I don t see any cause for optimism for this failed strategy of escalation  Frankly  I think the President s comments represent yet another example of the administration s delusion and denial   For years  this administration has refused to face the truth about Iraq  Let s take a look at some of the benchmarks the Bush administration told us would be met   We were told by the end of 2006 that a provincial election law would be approved and new election laws would be put in place  But that benchmark has not been met   We were told the Iraqis would approve a law for de Baathification  But that benchmark has not been met  In fact  the Iraqi Parliament is barely functioning  It is stuck in gridlock  Even worse  one of the Bush administration s best Iraqi allies  Ahmed Chalabi  has been leading the charge  this is one of the administration s best allies who has been leading the charge  to block the de Baathification legislation   We were told the Iraqis would create a law to help restrain sectarian militias  But that benchmark has not been met  In fact  the Iraqi Government hasn t disarmed the Shia militias  and the security situation on the ground continues to rage out of control  The surge hasn t staunched the violence  and civilian casualties were actually higher in June than in February when the surge began   We were told that the Iraqis would establish a law to regulate the oil industry and share revenues in Iraqi society  But that benchmark has not been met  In fact  the oil law is stuck in parliamentary gridlock  and it is unclear whether it actually addresses even the core issues   We were told that by March  this past March  that the Iraqi Government was supposed to hold a referendum on constitutional amendments necessary for a government of national unity to possibly exist  But that benchmark has not been met  In fact  3 years after the United States turned over power to the Iraqi Government  the Iraqis still don t have the constitution finished   The Bush administration seems to think that   satisfactory progress   has been made on performing a constitutional review committee  But in fact this committee has had to keep extending deadlines to get their work done  and it is unclear whether they will even meet the next deadline at the end of this month   As I said before  it is time that the administration and the President finally face the real facts  And the fact is  by invading Iraq  the President took our focus away from the war in Afghanistan  the birthplace of the Taliban  the home to al Qaeda  the land of Osama bin Laden  and the place where the attacks of September 11 were planned   Now  nearly 6 years after those terrible attacks on the United States  the most recent National Intelligence Estimate tells us that al Qaeda is operating where  In a safe zone along the Afghanistan Pakistan border  Let me repeat that  Al Qaeda is operating  according to the National Intelligence Estimate  in a safe zone along the Afghanistan Pakistan border   In fact  according to the New York Times  U S  officials have warned publicly that a deal between the Pakistani government and tribal leaders allowed al Qaeda to plot and train more freely in parts of western Pakistan for the last 10 months   It is clear that by shifting our efforts to Iraq  we have taken our eye off the original threat in Afghanistan  We cannot forget that our fight against terrorism started where it should have  in Afghanistan  an engagement that I supported  where it should have remained  But we have not yet been able to end the fight in Afghanistan   Now  as I listened to the debate here today  some of our Republican colleagues are back to the same parroting of the same old refrains  it won t work  criticizing Democrats as being weak on defense  It is we who have consistently called for finishing the job we started in Afghanistan  and bringing Osama bin Laden and his followers to justice  As far as I am concerned  to have him meet his maker  It was a Democratic Senator who offered a higher ransom on Osama bin Laden s head  It is Democrats  through the supplemental appropriations bill  who funded the resources for those men and women whom we supposedly are going to stand by so that they would have the plated jackets that they needed  and whom we sent into war without having the resources they needed  the vehicles to protect their lives as they seek to pursue their mission  the opportunity to make sure that a grateful nation says we are grateful not just on Memorial Day  marching in a parade  or on Veterans Day  going to an observance  which we should  but in how we treat those men and women in their injuries  in their disabilities  and for those who commit the ultimate sacrifice  in how we take care of their survivors  That is what Democrats did when they achieved the majority in this institution   So that old refrain  my friends  that Democrats are weak on defense  that dog won t hunt   I joined a rally earlier tonight outside the Capitol with Iraqi war veterans  In my mind  no one  no one  has a greater right to question their government and to say  as they did  that it is time to change the course in Iraq and bring their fellow soldiers home  and that is what they said tonight  They hold the high ground in any debate   Afghanistan was the right place to pursue the national security of the United States  It was in Afghanistan that the murderers of September 11 were located  We had Osama bin Laden pinned down in the mountains of Tora Bora  But instead of having a large contingent of the best trained  most equipped  most technologically advanced military in the world go after him  we outsourced the job to the warlords  We gave them money  and they put the money in their pockets and they let bin Laden get away   Many of us have been horrified as we have watched the resurgence of the Taliban  the new threats of al Qaeda in Afghanistan  and the increasing poppy cultivation  A few years ago  I talked about the possibility of the Iraqitization of Afghanistan  and now we see some of those fears coming true   Just last month  Afghan security forces found a new type of sophisticated roadside bomb  one that is very similar to that being used in Iraq  Afghans  and our troops in Afghanistan  face the daily horror of roadside bombs targeting civilians or coalition forces   The Taliban continues its battle to terrorize the Afghan people  As the New York Times article said last week   Shootings  beheadings  burnings  and bombings  These are the tools of intimidation used by the Taliban and others to shut down hundreds of Afghanistan s public schools  To take aim at education is to make war on the government   Afghanistan now produces 92 percent of the world s poppy  and it has a record crop again this year  Again  according to the New York Times   Not so long ago  we trumpeted Afghanistan as a success  a country freed from tyranny and al Qaeda  But as the Taliban s grip continues to tighten  threatening Afghanistan s future and the fight against terrorism  Americans and Afghans are frequently asking what went wrong   My friends  what went wrong is that instead of finishing the mission in Afghanistan  the President took us to Iraq  Of course  we remember all the reasons why  weapons of mass destruction  uranium from Niger  this in a State of the Union speech before the entire Congress  none of it true  The battle in Afghanistan  the battle against al Qaeda  the Taliban  against terrorism is far from over  Yet the United States is still held hostage by the President s war in Iraq  a war that we were led into based on a false premise  with false promises  with no plan to win the peace and no plan to succeed   The President is fond of evoking Franklin Roosevelt and our noble mission in World War II when he talks about Iraq  But he must have forgotten that when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor  Roosevelt didn t run off and invade China  That would have made no sense  Just like our going to Iraq made no sense because we dropped the ball in Afghanistan   The failures in Iraq  coupled with the reinvigoration of al Qaeda in Afghanistan  underscore the fiasco of the Bush administration s decision to take its focus off Afghanistan  its disastrous war policy  and the consequences of its stay the course mentality  They took their eye off the ball and created a quagmire in Iraq   We didn t have al Qaeda in Iraq  We now have elements of al Qaeda in Iraq  but we did not have al Qaeda in Iraq before we invaded  Now we are paying the price in the form of less security and a beefed up terrorist network  Maybe Secretary Chertoff s infamous gut feeling about an increased terror threat was caused by knowing that Osama bin Laden and his terrorist allies are still out there plotting and planning thousands of miles away from Iraq  thousands of miles away from Iraq   Madam President  let me conclude by stating that the President says that the only role for Congress is to provide a blank check for his failed war policy  He is so wrong  He is so wrong  Time to reread the Constitution  This body s responsibility is not to blindly sign a blank check to the President for a failed policy  We have a responsibility to the American people as fiduciaries both in terms of national treasure and lives  Most importantly  we have a responsibility to the men and women in uniform to do the right thing and stand up to the President s failed policy so that we may give them a mission worthy  worthy  of their sacrifice  We should honor the troops who continue to sacrifice and shed blood not by being silent  not by being hoarded like sheep  not by signing on to a blank check  and not by being complicit in the President s failed war   I have heard some of our colleagues on the other side cry that we are fighting for freedom in Iraq  but here in America  here tonight  we have the tyranny of a minority in the Senate who want to use the procedures of the Senate  in my mind in a way that is totally unacceptable  to thwart the will of the majority of the Senate  and  more importantly  the majority of the American people   We want a vote  not just any vote  a simple majority vote for majority rule  The amendment before us reflects the reality on the ground and the will of the American people  It changes the course in Iraq by setting a responsible timetable for our troops to leave  How many more lives  how many  I hope we all go home before tomorrow s vote and ask ourselves  how many more lives  how many more tens of billions of dollars  how much more chaos  We have heard about chaos  What will happen  how much more chaos can unfold than that which we see unfolding as we have 160 000 troops there   Years from now  we will come to the same conclusion  Or we can act with courage tomorrow in a vote  a simple majority vote  and by doing so we will be in a position to meet our national security challenges and our national interests  Our brave troops have answered the call of duty  Let s now answer the call to do what is right by them   It is clear to me that the President continues to live in a world where the reality in Iraq never collides with his fantasy of what is happening there  It is time for the President  and a minority in the Senate who support him  to give the American people a chance for a majority vote  for a majority rule  The American people have awoken way before the Senate  and they want the nightmare to end  The American people know it is time to responsibly withdraw from Iraq  The House of Representatives voted to do so  and it is time for the Senate to finally vote for a responsible withdrawal from Iraq   And so we close again  It is time for a simple majority vote for majority rule   Madam President  I yield the floor   To hear segments of the Senators floor speech  visit
