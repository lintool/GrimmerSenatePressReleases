    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Washington  D C    Wednesday  September 19  2007        Senator Arlen Specter  the longest serving Senator from Pennsylvania  today spoke on the floor of the Senate regarding the war in Iraq during debate of the Defense Authorization Act  A copy of his floor statement follows    Mr  SPECTER  Madam President  the issues relating to Iraq have been very complex  have aroused an enormous national reaction  and have been consuming for those of us in the Congress trying to decide what is the best course of action     Had we known Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction  I do not think we would have gone into Iraq  But once there  we do not want to leave precipitously  and we do not want to leave Iraq in an unstable condition with all of the potential forces that might bode ill for the United States in the future with respect to terrorism  with respect to Iran moving into a vacuum  and many complex problems which might arise     The President  in his recent speech  and General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker  in their testimony before Congress  have gone to considerable distance in trying to move toward some of the areas of concern  There have been commitments of troop withdrawal before Christmas  There are projections for additional troop withdrawal next year  There has been a modification to some extent of the mission  But still there is an unease with the current policy     I voted against the Levin Reed amendment when it came before the Senate because I think it is unwise to fix a firm date of withdrawal  It just gives the insurgents a target date to shoot at to declare victory     I think the provisions of the Warner Lugar amendment had much to recommend them and joined as a cosponsor  I have already expressed on the floor my concern that the Warner Lugar amendment was not called before the Senate  I think its thrust to have required a report by the President by October 15 and the possibility of a withdrawal date later but leaving the ultimate discretion to the President would have been a step forward  It would have imposed an obligation on the part of the President  the administration  to come forward with a plan     I have also cosponsored the Salazar Alexander amendment  which incorporates the findings of the independent study group  I believe that is a general outline which is desirable to follow  Again  I expressed my concern when the majority leader took down this bill before calling up the Salazar Alexander amendment  I have cosponsored that as an outline  Again  it does not place the administration in a straitjacket but outlines certain goals and certain objectives     I believe the idea advanced by Senator Biden for some time now  to divide Iraq into three parts    the Shiites  the Sunnis  and the Kurds    where those factions have been engaging in violent warfare  is an idea which is worth pursuing  Again  that is a matter which has to be decided by the Iraqi Government  not by the Congress of the United States  but Senator Biden has couched it in the form of a resolution  really  on what amounts to a recommendation     I have been considering the amendment offered by the junior Senator from Virginia  Mr  Webb  I discussed the issue with him last week and since that time have undertaken to try to find out what the impact of the Webb amendment would be on force projection     I met with LTG Carter Ham last week  General Ham is in charge of operations at the Joint Chiefs of Staff  During the course of that meeting  General Ham outlined the projection by the Department of Defense that they could meet that 1 to 1 ratio    12 months in Iraq and 12 months at home  which is the thrust of the Webb amendment    that they could meet that objective by October 1  2008  the beginning of the next fiscal year  General Ham was not supportive of the Webb amendment because he raised a number of concerns that on its face  if you enact the Webb amendment  there are troops in Iraq now who will have to stay longer  There would have to be additional calls to the Reserves and National Guard  There might be a need to take people out of units which would impact on morale  but that if there were an October 1 date  2008  that the 1 to 1 ratio could be achieved  according to the Department of Defense projections     Earlier today  at the invitation of Senator Warner  I met to talk again to LTG Carter Ham and to LTG Lovelace who works with General Ham  During the course of that meeting  the target date of October 1  2008  to be the 1 to 1 ratio was reaffirmed  There was an additional factor injected into the discussion  and that is the factor of some 5 500 additional troops in a variety of categories  special forces and others  where this 1 to 1 ratio could not be met by October 1     Following that meeting  I have had telephone conversations with Secretary of Defense Gates and National Security Advisor Hadley to get some sense of the position of the Department of Defense and the administration  Secretary Gates confirmed the ability of the Department of Defense to meet in general terms the 1 to 1 ratio by October 1  2008  He talked about some other difficulties and  obviously  is not endorsing any plan  The administration would prefer not to have any congressional action on this subject  Similarly  after an extended telephone conversation with National Security Advisor Hadley  I heard the reasons there is opposition    the difficulty of knowing whether the factors on the ground will be as they are projected now  and they are resisting congressional action which would tie the hands of the administration     In considering these issues  I have been very concerned about the problems of micromanaging the Department of Defense by the Congress  There is no question we are not equipped to do that  I have studied the constitutional law aspects  and I studied the case of Fleming v  Page  50 U S  603  1850    a decision by Chief Justice Taney  and the case of the United States v  Lovett  328 U S  303  1946    decided by the Supreme Court in 1946  I am well aware of the authority  the broad authority the Constitution vests in the President under Article II as Commander in Chief  but I am also cognizant of the authority of the Congress under Article I  Section 8  To raise and support Armies  To provide and maintain a Navy  To make rules for the government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces  To provide for organizing  arming  and disciplining  the Militia  and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States     We have seen the Supreme Court recently strike down executive action on military commissions  saying it is the function of the Congress of the United States  and the Congress has acted there  So there is authority for the Congress on that premise  in addition to our power of the purse  our power of appropriation     I have discussed the matter with Senator Webb and have indicated    have stated an interest on my part in supporting the Webb amendment  if the concerns which have been expressed to me by the Department of Defense could be accommodated  and that is a change of date to October 1  and an accommodation of the 5 500 specialty forces that cannot be enumerated  Of course  there is the waiver provision which is already present in the Webb amendment  I asked about the possibility of deferring the vote  I think that if there was an understanding by other Senators about the ability of the Department of Defense to meet a 2008 October 1 date  and the flexibility needed on some 5 500 additional troops  there might be some additional interest in the amendment  I am told  at least as of this moment of 4 36  the vote is going to go ahead 5 15  But I have discussed the matter  as I say  with the sponsor of the amendment  Senator Webb     There is also the obvious factor that what we do here is unlikely  in any event  to have the full effect of law  If the Webb amendment gets 60 votes and is embodied in congressional enactment  it is virtually certain to be vetoed by the President of the United States  and there are not 67 votes to override a Presidential veto  But our function in the Congress is to exercise our best judgment and pass what we think is appropriate  Then  under our constitutional system  it is the prerogative of the President to either sign or veto  So we take all of these matters a step at a time  There is a lot of concern in the Congress of the United States about what is happening now  and an interest in  if it can be structured  congressional action which would be helpful  All of this is obviously very involved and requires a lot of analysis and consideration     I think it would be a very helpful thing for the U S  effort  generally  if the Congress and the President could come to an agreement on a policy and a plan without leaving it solely to the discretion of the executive branch  The Congress is going to continue funding  and I have voted for that  We are not going to put the troops at risk  We are not going to set times for withdrawal  It is possible we could use the Vietnam model  where funding existed up to a certain date on the condition that the troops be reduced to a certain number and then by another date  That hasn t been tried  but I think it unlikely the Congress is going to go that route  We are too concerned about the troops and we want to support them  but we are also gripped with a sense of unease as to what is happening     There is agreement between the Department of Defense  for the purpose of Senator Webb s amendment  that the stays in Iraq are too long  We have noted the increase in the suicide rate  the increase in the divorce rate  the increase in psychiatric problems and stress disorders  The policy of the Department of Defense is to have 2 months at home for every 1 month in Iraq for the Army  5 months at home for every 1 month in Iraq for the Reserves  We are far from that  So we are struggling and groping to try to find an answer  In the course of the remaining time before the roll is called  I am going to see if it is possible to find some constructive way forward and some rational basis for the vote I will cast       I yield the floor  and I suggest the absence of a quorum                                                                    Browse by
