    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Washington  D C    Thursday  March 15  2007     Senator Arlen Specter  the Senior Senator from Pennsylvania  made the following comments today on the senate floor    Mr  President  the Senate is now engaged in a historic debate about what the United States of America should do with respect to the conflict in Iraq  We are scheduled to vote on three resolutions at 3 45 this afternoon  I was advised early this morning  about 8 a m   that we would have four resolutions to vote on and that there would be a time agreement of some 6 hours  with votes to occur late this afternoon  Two of the resolutions among the four were not in existence  one of the resolutions has since been dropped  and the fourth resolution was made available less than an hour ago  This kind of a timetable  it seems to me  is not conducive to the kind of deliberation and thought necessary to make intelligent decisions on the momentous questions which we are facing     We are asking the U S  military to adopt a timetable to clear out of Iraq no later than a year from now  and we have a tough time establishing even a timetable as to what the Senate will do in the course of a single day     As I review the proceedings  it seems to me that the Congress is not prepared to act on this subject on this state of the record  It may be that the Congress is not competent to act on this kind of an issue  There is a maxim that you can t manage effectively by committee  and what this concurrent resolution seeks to do is to have management by two committees    that is perhaps twice as bad as trying to manage by one committee    a committee of 435 in the House of Representatives and a committee of 100 here     Yesterday  I spoke briefly about S  Res  9  which has been cosponsored by 41 Democrats  no Republicans  I think it is regrettable that there appears to be a partisan divide on this subject  This matter is too important to be determined by party loyalty  Perhaps a more important aspect of noting that the resolution is supported by 41 Democrats is that it is not supported by 9 Democrats  with 50 Democrats in this body  So perhaps it is significant that it is not supported by 9 Democrats     I would be prepared to cross party lines  as I have done in the past when I thought it warranted  if I agreed with the thrust of the resolution  Seven of us joined with the Democrats in voting for cloture several weeks ago to move ahead with the debate and try to come to a resolution on the Iraqi issue  and I was one of the seven  I would not hesitate to do so again if I agreed  but I cannot agree with the proposal which would require that not later than 120 days after enactment to have phased redeployment of U S  forces  with the goal of redeploying by March 31  2008  all U S  combat forces in Iraq except for three conditions  to protect U S  and coalition personnel  training and equipping Iraqi forces  and conducting targeted counterterrorism operations     The thrust  however  is to leave Iraq in about 1 year  and that is to ensure defeat  Setting a timetable simply enables our opponents to wait us out     I think beyond that  the idea of having the Congress of the United States micromanage the war is simply not realistic  and perhaps it may even be unlawful  As I noted yesterday  in the case of Fleming v  Page  in 1850  the Supreme Court said    As Commander in Chief  he is authorized to direct the movements of the naval and military forces placed by law at his command  and to employ them in the manner he may deem most effectual to harass and conquer and subdue the enemy      That is a fairly forceful statement that it is not up to the Congress to micromanage a war but that it is up to the Commander in Chief  the President of the United States  That is not to say that the Congress does not have authority in the premises  Yesterday  I put into the Record a lengthy letter which I had written calling for additional hearings by the Judiciary Committee on the relative powers  authority of the Congress under the Constitution  with our power of the purse and our power to maintain and direct armies  contrasted with the President s power as Commander in Chief     I believe  however  it is of questionable legal authority to micromanage  and it is definitely impractical for us to seek to micromanage if the consequences of giving an order to the President would just enable the enemy to wait us out  That is not to say that at some time in the future it may be necessary  and there may be a considered joint judgment by the Congress  to use the extraordinary power of the purse to implement our constitutional authority to maintain armies to effectuate a withdrawal     Yesterday  I commented on the Senate floor that it would be most helpful to have an update from the Department of Defense and the Department of State as to whether  since General Petraeus went to Iraq  implementing a new strategy as he articulated it to many of us in the Congress in meeting with him  whether there have been improvements  so that there was some realistic prospect of victory  which is what we want  The consequences of defeat are disastrous  but that does not mean that we can be in Iraq forever     The President  in his State of the Union speech  set two objectives for the Iraqis  One was to end the sectarian violence and  secondly  to secure Baghdad as indispensable prerequisites for maintaining U S  forces in Iraq  The Iraqis have shown neither the capacity nor the will to carry out those objectives  In evaluating the strategy of General Petraeus  it would be helpful to know if there have been any positive signs or negative signs  giving us some clue as to the prospects of victory     Through staff  I made an inquiry of the Department of Defense for some updated material  and none was available  Similarly  through staff  I made an inquiry of the Department of State  asking if there had been any results from the change in policy to negotiate with Iran and Syria  at least on a multilateral basis  One part of the resolution that is supported by 41 Democrats  calling for a comprehensive diplomatic  political  and economic strategy  has been implemented by the Department of State  at least in the incipient stages  Even in the absence of any indication of any progress  it seems to me unwise  on this state of the record  to set a timetable which would just embolden and empower the enemy to win by waiting us out     The power of the purse is the ultimate constitutional authority of the Congress  Even there  as I noted yesterday in the case of United States v  Lovett  in 1946  the Supreme Court held that Congress cannot use its appropriations power indirectly to accomplish an unconstitutional objective  That still leaves substantial parameters to decide what to do     The second resolution is the one submitted by Senator Gregg  and Senator Gregg articulates a resolution that all of us agree with    That it is the sense of Congress that Congress should not take any action that will endanger United States military forces in the field        That would be unthinkable  No one disagrees with that  Then the Gregg resolution goes on to say       including the elimination or reduction of funds for troops in the field      That phrase could be interpreted to mean that Congress does not have the authority to stipulate an elimination or reduction of funds for troops in the field so that we couldn t say to the President to reduce the troops by a certain date  Or perhaps it should be read in conjunction with taking no action to endanger to say you have to be down to a certain number by a certain date  as Congress did in legislation in 1974  saying that when the war in Vietnam was winding down  there could be no more than 4 000 troops in the field in 6 months and no more than 3 000 troops in the field in a year     That congressional legislation was signed by President Ford  although he expressed some reservations  So perhaps the Gregg resolution does not purport to totally eliminate the authority of Congress to act by cutting off funding if it can be done in a way which does not endanger the troops in the field  Certainly the thrust  the gravamen of the Gregg resolution is one where there would be no disagreement  we simply could not endanger the troops in the field or take any action which would endanger them    Then the third resolution    which was filed less than an hour ago by Senator Murray    sounds very much like the Gregg resolution  It is intended  I think  to provide an alternative to the Gregg resolution  but it is very close  The Murray resolution provides   the President and Congress should not take any action that will endanger the Armed Forces of the United States and will provide necessary funds for training  equipment and other support for troops in the field as such actions will ensure their safety and effectiveness in preparing for and carrying out their assigned missions     We all agree with that  Then it goes on to say   the President  Congress and the Nation have an obligation to ensure that those who have bravely served this country in time of war receive the medical care and other support they deserve     No one could disagree with that  It is a reference to what has happened at Walter Reed  Then the third clause in the resolution    Resolved  The President and Congress should continue to exercise their constitutional responsibilities to ensure that the Armed Forces have everything they need to perform their assigned or future missions      We can t disagree with that  And then      review  assess and adjust United States policy and funding as needed to ensure our troops have the best chance for success in Iraq and elsewhere     That also is apple pie  motherhood  and milk  There is a little implication  on  review  assess and adjust   perhaps a change in policy  but it does not say anything definitive    There was supposed to have been a fourth resolution offered by Senator Warner  who had an earlier resolution which was not taken up by the Senate  Senator Warner is to be commended for his service to the country  heading the Armed Services Committee  28 years in this body  Secretary of the Navy  served in World War II  He was searching for some alternative  But in the absence of any resolution having been filed  the inference arises that the search continues  That is where I think we are on this issue    The electorate spoke last November in disagreeing with United States policy in Iraq  The House of Representatives has spoken  disagreeing with United States policy in Iraq  The Senate is about to speak  but it is highly doubtful    virtually impossible that a forced withdrawal within a year will be approved by 60 Members of this body  The resolutions by Senator Gregg and Senator Murray are not twins  but they are first cousins  But we are still groping for what to do    My own sense of the situation is we need to pursue some preliminary reports that things are improving and find out if in fact that is true  As I look at Iraq    and I used the metaphor yesterday    it is a tunnel and we can t see the end of the tunnel  Certainly there is no indication that there is a light in the end of the tunnel  I don t like being in the tunnel  but I don t know where else to go at the moment    I am not going to go with a resolution to leave Iraq  micromanage the war  tell the President what to do when we frankly don t know what to do  But we are groping  Just as we are unprepared to deal with these resolutions in a limited time  by 3 45  we are unprepared to tell the military what to do in a year  So I think we need to go back to the drawing boards and I think we need to find out more facts  It may be General Shinseki was right in 2003  that job required a lot more personnel  into the hundreds of thousands  under the Colin Powell doctrine of overwhelming force  Maybe that was the course which should have been followed  Certainly we don t want to deploy more troops now  in those quantities  For General Shinseki s brilliance  he got himself fired  ridiculed and fired  We are trying to find out what to do    I had an opportunity to visit the Mideast and talk to President Assad of Syria last December  President Assad advanced the idea of having an international conference before the idea was advanced by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice  I carried that message back and conveyed Assad s suggestion to Condoleezza Rice  Whether that had any impact on her idea  I don t know  But I do believe    and I said this in a lengthy speech on the Senate floor last June  and in an article which appears in the current issue of the Washington Quarterly    that dialog should be undertaken with Iran and Syria  We have seen the multilateral dialog with North Korea  supplemented by direct contracts  bilateral negotiations  produce what appears to be an answer to diffusing North Korea s possession of nuclear weapons  We don t know for sure because that is a very tentative basis  but we made a lot of progress and we appear to have an answer    I think there is cause for hope that the multilateral talks with Iran and Syria  and perhaps bilateral talks  will produce something there  So I am going to oppose S  Res  9 and I am going to support the first cousins  the Gregg resolution and the Murray resolution  They say something which is obvious  We are not going to take any action to endanger the American troops  But that does not mean we are without power in the future to use the appropriations power  the power of the purse  to put Congress s imprimatur and decision on what is going on    The President said for a long time he was the decider  I think he has wisely receded a little from that assertion  It is a joint  shared responsibility between Congress and the President  There has been a lot of talk  I think the American people ought to know there has been a lot of    it is more than talk  there has been a lot of very serious thought which has been undertaken by the Members of the Congress  both the Senate and the House  trying to find a way to have a victory in Iraq  Our statements of disagreement with the President do not mean we ought to tell him what to do when in fact we do not know what to do    For myself  I think we need to find out more about what is happening now  both militarily and diplomatically  going back to the drawing board and seeing if we can come up with a better answer than the one we are facing at the present time    I thank the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma  who is managing the bill   I yield the floor                                                                    Browse by
