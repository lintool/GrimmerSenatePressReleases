    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Washington  D C    Wednesday  March 14  2007     Senator Arlen Specter  the Senior Senator from Pennsylvania  made the following comments today on the senate floor     Mr  President  the Senate has now commenced the debate on an issue of great importance  really of historic importance  which challenges us on the issue of what course of action we should take in Iraq  in a very complex factual situation  and challenges us on what our authority is under the Constitution  contrasted with the President s authority as Commander in Chief     On the factual issue  when we look at the resolution  which calls for the phased redeployment of the U S  forces from Iraq not later than 120 days after enactment of this joint resolution  with the goal of deploying by March 31  2008  all U S  combat forces  except for three purposes  one  to protect the U S  and coalition personnel and infrastructure  second  training and equipping Iraqi forces  third  conducting targeted counterterrorism operations    We are setting a deadline and our opponents simply have to wait us out  They know if they can hold on until March 31  2008  a little more than a year from now  we will be leaving  except for those stated limited purposes  That is not a very desirable course of conduct     It is equally undesirable  however  to view the current situation in Iraq  which looks like an endless tunnel    a tunnel without a light at the end  You cannot see the end of the tunnel and  certainly  there is no light at the end of the tunnel in terms of what we can do     Last month  the House of Representatives passed a nonbinding resolution expressing displeasure  objecting to the President s course of action in Iraq  Last November  in the election  the American people spoke in a resounding manner  in a way that could only rationally be interpreted as rejecting the conduct of the war in Iraq  We are faced with very considerable discomfort in this body  How it will resolve itself remains to be seen  I think it is very important that we debate this matter  that we exchange our views  that we stimulate discussions that will go beyond this Chamber and will resound throughout the country  resound throughout the editorial pages and the television and radio talk shows  and by our colleagues in the corridors and in the cloakroom so that we can try to work our way through an extraordinarily difficult situation where  as I see it  there is no good answer between the two intractable alternatives to set a timetable where our opponents simply have to wait us out or to keep proceeding down a tunnel which  at least at this juncture  appears to be endless and has no light  We don t know where the end is  let alone to have a light at the end of the tunnel     What I am trying to do at the moment is to get from the administration  from the Department of Defense  and the Department of State an evaluation of what has happened since General Petraeus briefed us on what he intended to do before he returned to Iraq several weeks ago  There have been some preliminary reports that the strategy employed by General Petraeus is producing results  There have been some commentaries     The Washington Post last Sunday in an op ed suggested things are improving  Reports by NBC s Brian Williams suggest that matters are improving  not sufficiently definitive to come to any conclusion  but if there was a sign on the military side that we could see improvement and see a path to victory  that would have a material bearing on what this body would do or at least on the thinking of this Senator     The resolution calls for a comprehensive strategy  and it defines it as  diplomatic  political  and economic strategy that includes sustained engagement with Iraq s neighbors and the international community for the purpose of working collectively to bring stability to Iraq      I was pleased to hear the testimony of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice  when she appeared before the Appropriations Committee on which I sit on February 27  2007  announcing the initiative of an international conference to be held in Baghdad and announcing for the first time that there would be negotiations by the United States in a conference which included Iran and Syria  which I think is a very important and sensible change in the foreign policy of the United States     We saw the results in North Korea where we faced a very difficult situation with North Korea possessing nuclear weapons and the various tests they had undertaken  We saw the multilateral discussions and then  more importantly  saw bilateral talks between the United States and North Korea  which Secretary of State Rice obtained the authority of the President to engage in those direct bilateral talks so when she was traveling overseas  she did not go through the normal vetting and analytical processes in Washington which might well have stopped that direct bilateral discussion  It did occur  and it appears to have been instrumental in working out what may well be a diplomatic answer  It appears that way at the present time  although no one can ever be sure in dealing with North Korea     I would like to have an up to date evaluation    and I am seeking one    from the Department of State as to what is happening with those negotiations  Candidly  it is pretty hard when we have one of our sessions in room 407 upstairs  which is the secret room where we are briefed  We very seldom get much information there  I think it would be very useful if we could find information to bring us up to date as to what progress  if any  the administration is making  I know  to repeat  it would be very influential on my thinking as to what course I will take when the roll is called on these resolutions     Beyond the evaluation of the factual situation  there are very complex legal questions involved in what is the authority of Congress  The resolution does not call upon the congressional constitutional authority on appropriations or the so called power of the purse  We know there is authority in the Congress to cut off funding  I think there is unanimous agreement that we should not even broach the issue cutting off funding if in any way it would jeopardize the troops who are serving in Iraq     The President s powers as Commander in Chief have been the subject of judicial interpretation  In the case of Fleming v  Page    it goes back a long way to 1850    but the Supreme Court said     As commander in chief  he is authorized to direct the movements of the naval and military forces placed by law at his command  and to employ them in the manner he may deem most effectual to harass and conquer and subdue the enemy      On the face of that statement by the Nation s highest Court  there is a real question as to whether Congress has the constitutional authority to order the  phased redeployment of the United States forces from Iraq      The Supreme Court dealt with the issue on the power of the purse in the case of United States v  Lovett in 1946  holding that Congress cannot use its appropriations power indirectly to accomplish an unconstitutional objective    So that brings into play squarely what is the constitutional authority of the President as Commander in Chief     I think it is most unwise for Congress to even broach the subject of micromanagement of the war  When Congressman Murtha suggested some time ago that funding be conditioned on a whole series of requirements  it bore all the earmarks of micromanagement of the war     The resolution at hand calling for a redeployment may well cross that line of micromanagement of the war  It is unclear  But there remains the very deep concern in the country  expressed by the electorate last November  expressed by citizens across the country that reflected in the resolution passed by the House of Representatives last month objecting to the administration s conduct of the war and considerable sentiment in this body so that we are searching for a way to approach this issue rationally     We have to face up to the consequence that if we acknowledge defeat in Iraq  there are very disastrous consequences which will flow from that  disastrous consequences in the region  the issue of whether the terrorists will come at least in part from the Mideast to threaten us on the homeland  But  at the same time  we have to recognize that when the President laid down two markers in his State of the Union speech earlier this year  that the Iraqis accomplish two objectives  One  to stabilize Baghdad  and  two  to end sectarian violence  The Iraqis have not shown either the capacity or the will to accomplish those two prerequisites which the President set down as minimal markers     My thinking is we ought to deliberate on this subject  We ought to hear each other out  and we ought to seek updated information from the administration to see whether there are any signs  in the several weeks since General Petraeus has undertaken the new strategy  whether there are any indications of what may lie ahead on the negotiations  now that there have been contacts by the United States with Iranian officials and presumably also with Syrian officials     I would like to see this Chamber filled with Senators when we undertake this debate  I recollect the debate we had back in 1991  which was classified as historic  when we decided to pass a resolution authorizing the use of force  I know we are all very busy  I am about to go to a hearing of a subcommittee on Labor  Health  Human Services  and Education  This issue warrants the close attention of the Senate  We have been called the world s greatest deliberative body  and this issue now will give us a chance to see if we are entitled to that lofty title     Mr  President  I ask unanimous consent that a letter I sent to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee  outlining underlying legal issues in the debate we are now undertaking  be printed in the Record                                                                    Browse by                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Current record
