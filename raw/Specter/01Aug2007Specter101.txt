    United States Senator Arlen Specter  Pennsylvania   News Room                                                                                                                                                                                                                 News Room News Releases                               Washington  D C     Wednesday  August 1  2007     U S  Senator Arlen Specter  R Pa   ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell  R KY   today offered an amendment to legislation currently pending on the Senate floor that would express the sense of the Senate that the nomination of Judge Leslie Southwick to the U S  Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit should receive a vote by the full Senate     The amendment reads  It Is The Sense Of The Senate That The Nomination Of Judge Leslie Southwick To The United States Court Of Appeals For The Fifth Circuit Should Receive A Vote By The Full Senate     Below is a copy of Senator Specters floor statement      I have sought recognition to speak briefly on the nomination of Judge Leslie Southwick to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit  I have spoken extensively about Judge Southwick in the past  but I do want to address a few remarks on the pending amendment offered by Senator McConnell and myself on the sense of the Senate that Judge Southwick ought to have an up or down vote on the floor of the Senate  It is my hope that we will proceed on judicial confirmations in a spirit of bipartisanship  Senator Leahy  chairman of the Judiciary Committee  and I have worked very closely on that in this Congress  as he and I did in the 109th Congress when I was chairman and he was ranking member       This body has seen some very controversial moments  in 2005  with filibusters against President Bush s nominees and the threat at that time to invoke the nuclear or constitutional option which would have brought the Senate to a standstill  We avoided that showdown and then worked harmoniously  in a dignified way  with Supreme Court nominations in 2005 and 2006  It is my hope we will find a way through on the Southwick nomination  I hope we do not have this vote degenerate back to a party line vote without the kind of independent thought the Senate ought to exercise in evaluating the question which is whether Judge Southwick ought to have an up or down vote       Judge Southwick has an extraordinary record  I do not use that word lightly  He served on the Mississippi State appellate court for some 12 years  He has been a party to some 8 000 decisions  He has written 985 opinions himself  He is rated unanimously well qualified by the American Bar Association  He passed out of the Judiciary Committee  unanimously  for a district court judgeship  He has been an adjunct professor at a law school  He was clerk of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit  so he has experience there  In a very unusual way  in his fifties  he volunteered for the Judge Advocate General s Corps  volunteered to go to Iraq and served there in a heavy combat zone       I have had occasion to talk to him at great length  and he is a scholarly  intellectual  experienced lawyer  an experienced jurist  I have put into the Record detailed statements about many of his decisions where he has found in favor of the so called little guy  finding in favor of people who have tort claims for injuries sustained  in favor of employees in employment cases       The only two situations which have been brought up in opposition to Judge Southwick are two cases where he concurred in an opinion  two opinions which he did not write  In one of the opinions  it was a custody case  and the court found in favor of the father  There was a reference to the homosexual lifestyle of the mother which is a term that is used with some frequency  I think there could be more discretion in that language  but the court found in favor of the father because of his community roots  because of the home he could provide for the child  and because of the father s income  The important thing about that case was its procedural posture  That was the sum and substance of that matter       There was a second case where the issue involved a racial slur which admittedly was reprehensible  It was said by an individual  a public employee  about a fellow worker who was not present at the time  The subject did not hear the slur  There was an immediate apology  There was no workplace disturbance  The issue then came before an administrative review board that found that although the comment was reprehensible  under these facts it was not sufficient to support termination of employment  That issue then came back before the appellate court on a very narrow question  The question was whether the decision by the administrative board was arbitrary and capricious  which is lawyer talk for whether there was any evidence to support the boards ruling  The court felt that there was evidence to support the conclusion that there was not sufficient grounds for firing  The case then went to the State Supreme Court  and the State Supreme Court remanded on the limited question about having more detailed factual findings  But the Supreme Court of Mississippi agreed that the incident was not sufficient to warrant a permanent firing       That is the sum and substance of the objections  When you look at the full record  you see that Judge Southwick ruled in a case where the trial judge had excluded evidence that the victim of a crime was gay  and Judge Southwick upheld the ruling that that would have been prejudicial  defense counsel should not have been permitted to ask that of a victim  seeking only to prejudice the jury  It did not having any bearing on the issue involved in the case  This supports the conclusion that Judge Southwick  in the custody case to which I referred  did not have any demonstrate traits or indications that he was biased or prejudiced or unjudicial in his approach to that particular issue       It is my hope we will take a careful look at Judge Southwicks record before casting votes  I understand there will be a tabling motion  We should look at the underlying merits       When we had the controversy in 2005  I urged my colleagues in the strongest terms to take a look at whether they thought individually filibusters were warranted against Priscilla Owen and Bill Pryor and Janice Rogers Brown  I asked my Republican colleagues to take a look on the merits as to whether it was warranted to talk about a nuclear or constitutional option  I make the same plea here today  Let s not be bound by a party line vote  ignoring the merits       There have been comments on the floor today  as there have been in the past  about President Clinton s nominees being improperly treated  I agree with that today  and I agreed with that when it happened  and I crossed party lines  I have crossed party lines to vote for President Clinton s judicial nominees when they were qualified  I hope we will come in the Senate  take a look at the individuals  take a look at the merits  and not move for a party line consideration  and not avoid a vote  to have the man bottled up in committee  That smacks of the days of Senator Jim Eastland  when the Judiciary Committee bottled matters and prevented the Senate from voting on them       I can understand there are some Senators who do not want a vote on Judge Southwick  but that is what we are here for  That is the pay grade    to vote  So I urge my colleagues to look at this matter on the merits  I hope we do not have our actions disintegrate to the kind of controversy we had a couple years ago  but that we can move beyond this to the kind of bipartisanship which Senator Leahy and I have been able to muster for the Judiciary Committee       I thank the Senator from Montana for allowing me to speak  I know the Senator from South Carolina  Mr  Lindsey Graham  has a few comments  I expect he will be very brief on the subject                                                                     Browse by
