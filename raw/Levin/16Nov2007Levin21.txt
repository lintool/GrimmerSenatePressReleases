delivered the following statement on the Senate floor this morning regarding the Senate   s consideration of the Orderly and Responsible Iraq Redeployment Appropriations Act  2008   The bill would provide  50 billion for ongoing military operations in Iraq      Once again the Senate has an opportunity to address the situation in Iraq   This morning  we are considering a motion to proceed to H R  4156 that contains a so called bridge fund of  50 billion for ongoing military operations in Iraq         The House passed bill provides for the President  within 30 days after enactment  to commence a phased redeployment of U S  forces from Iraq and for the transition of those forces to specific missions   1  protecting U  S  diplomatic facilities  U S  forces  American citizens   2  conducting limited training  equipping and providing logistical and intelligence support to Iraqi Security Forces  and  3  engaging in targeted counterterrorism operations against Al Qaeda  al Qaeda affiliated groups  and other terrorist organizations in Iraq  It sets a goal for the completion of the transition would be December 15  2008         Some argue that we should not identify the new more limited missions or commit to transition to them  The President told the American people of September 13 that we will transition to a new phase starting in December and that    As this transition in mission takes place  our troops will focus on a more limited set of tasks  including counterrorism operations and training  equipping  and supporting Iraqi forces      Does that sound familiar  Well  it   s like the House passed language before us       It   s the goal of completing the transition that he objects to   although it   s a goal and not binding   Setting a goal may be too much for he who is unwilling to set a goal   but just don   t misrepresent it as a fixed timetable when it is stated as a goal          From all accounts  the surge has already produced militarily progress   sectarian violence in most regions of Iraq  particularly Baghdad  is down         The problem is that  while the surge has at this point seen militarily progress  it has not accomplished its primary purpose as announced by President Bush last January  when he stated that its purpose was to give the Iraqi government    the breathing space it needs to make progress in other critical areas     The President also said that    America will hold the Iraqi government to the benchmarks it has announced      Well we haven   t   The President statement that he    will hold the Iraqi government to the benchmarks it has announced    is so much hollow rhetoric   Those benchmarks include approving a hydrocarbon law  approving a de Baathification law  completing the work of a Constitutional Review Committee  and holding provincial elections   Those commitments  made one and a half years ago  which were to have been completed by January 2007  have not yet been kept by the Iraqi political leaders despite the breathing space the surge has provided   As a matter of fact  the Iraqi leaders appear to be farther apart today than they were at the start of the surge   The Iraqi political leadership   s response to the breathing space provided by the surge has been nothing less than abysmal                     One year ago this month  the Prime Minister of Iraq  Nouri al Maliki himself   The crisis is political  and the ones who can stop the cycle of aggravation and bloodletting of innocents are the  Iraqi  politicians   Secretary of Defense Gates agreed with that assessment in December of last year  President Bush agreed in January  Petraeus agreed in September  If everyone agrees that this is a political crisis  why does the administration keep focusing on military solutions       General Odierno  according to yesterday   s Washington Post  described the breathing space as a window of opportunity  which may close at any time   Whether the Iraqi political leaders decide to take advantage of this window of opportunity is of course their decision   We can   t make that decision for them   They are a sovereign country       But how long U S  forces remain deployed to Iraq  and with what missions  and how long U S  forces continue to fight the insurgency instead of the Iraqi army taking over that fight  and how long we continue to subject our brave and valiant servicemen and women to the risk of death and serious injury   those decisions are in our hands       Secretary Gates has said that pressure on the Iraqi political leaders is useful   President Bush has acknowledged as much   How can Congress act to put pressure on the Iraqi political leaders   By setting a goal for the transition of the missions of U S  forces in Iraq to the more supporting and less direct role  The Baker Hamilton Iraq Study Group in their December 2006 report essentially called for a transition of the mission of U S  forces in Iraq very much like that called for in this bill   only they called for it to take place by the first quarter of 2008       We need to do more than say to the Iraqis that our patience has run out and that they need to seize the opportunity that has been given them   Their dawdling will only end when they have no choice       The bill we will hopefully vote for sets a goal for completion of a transition to missions the President has said were going to transition to   I wish it were binding but setting a timetable as a goal is better than silence which leaves in place the open endedness of our current presence       It is that open ended commitment which continues to create in the minds of the Iraqi political leaders the false impression that their future is in our hands instead of theirs       We should vote for cloture on the House passed bill and be allowed to vote on its substance
