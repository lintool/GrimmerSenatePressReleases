                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Tonight the Senate will vote on the nomination of Judge Michael Mukasey to be Attorney General   His nomination comes at a critical time   At this moment in history  America is faced with serious challenges both at home and abroad   We are at war in Iraq and Afghanistan and are engaged in a long term struggle against al Qa   ida and other extremists   Military might alone will not be enough for us to win these fights   Strengthening America   s security requires us to harness the power of our ideals and values and lead a global effort to confront these threats   When we project moral hypocrisy or suggest that our commitment to our fundamental values depends on the circumstances  we lose the support of the world in our common efforts against common enemies  thereby compromising our own security        The pictures of American soldiers mistreating prisoners at Abu Ghraib and the stories of detainee abuse at Guantanamo Bay compromised our moral authority and our ability to lead the global struggle against al Qa   ida   America must demonstrate an unambiguous commitment to basic human rights   And this is not some intellectual musing   It is hard headed pragmatism        Earlier this year  I visited some of our veterans at a Michigan VA hospital   I asked one Korean War veteran who was lying in his bed  What can we do to help you  And do you know what he said     Win back the respect of people around the world for America      That veteran understands that the erosion of support for America makes us less secure and weakens us in a way that military force cannot remedy         I   ve devoted significant time looking into the issue of detainee abuse and considering what is appropriate when it comes to the treatment of detainees in U S  custody   Building back the respect for America that the Michigan veteran and all of us seek requires a definitive commitment to treating all people     even our enemies     in a manner consistent with both our laws and basic human rights       Last month I asked Judge Michael Mukasey  President   s Bush   s nominee to be Attorney General of the United States  what I thought was a straightforward question for the record     Would you consider it inhumane to secure a detainee onto a flat surface and slowly pour water directly onto the detainee   s face or onto a towel covering the detainee   s face in a manner that induced a perception by the detainee that he was drowning          That question to Judge Mukasey should have prompted a simple answer of    yes      But the Judge said that  while the tactic is    repugnant    to him  he could not say it was inhumane without evaluating the    facts and circumstances      Judge Mukasey   s ambiguous response is more than deeply troubling  it sends a message     from the man nominated to head the Department of Justice     that abuses of detainees in U S  custody may not have been categorically wrong  but that such acts might have been justified by the circumstances       In 2002  the Department of Defense requested authority to use a number of aggressive interrogation techniques     including mock drowning     on detainees held at Guantanamo Bay   FBI agents vigorously objected to the aggressive techniques   One stated in a legal analysis that aggressive techniques  including mock drowning  were    not permitted by the U S  Constitution            Another FBI agent also expressed alarm to his Justice Department colleagues over a DOD interrogation plan for a detainee held at Guantanamo Bay  saying    You won   t believe it      An e mail described abuses that a FBI agent had witnessed  including detainees being chained in fetal positions on the floor for 18 to 24 hours at a time  having urinated and defecated on themselves and being subjected to extreme cold         If Judge Mukasey were to be confirmed to lead the Department of Justice  he would take charge of the FBI   How would Judge Mukasey respond to those FBI agents   Would he have said that the validity of those objections depended on the    circumstances            Over the past five years  the Department of Justice has repeatedly issued aggressive legal opinions that seek to exploit any possible legal ambiguity to justify the Administration   s policies   In 2002  for example  the Department of Justice issued a now disavowed memo finding that physical pain had to be    equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury  such as organ failure  impairment of bodily function  or even death    to constitute torture   The Executive Order that the President issued in July of this year interprets Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions to bar only those outrageous acts that are done    for the purpose of humiliating or degrading the individual      The Geneva Conventions make no such distinction   These results driven interpretations of law have contributed to the negative image of the United States in the world  leaving many to question why we attempt to impose standards on other countries that we do not require of ourselves   These interpretations endanger our troops when captured because their captors will cite these interpretations to justify abuses of our troops       It does a disservice to our Nation for a person who has been nominated to lead the Department of Justice to hide behind purposeful ambiguities  particularly at a time when our nation   s prestige has been so tarnished by abuses against detainees in our custody   The legality of mock drowning  waterboarding  does not depend on the circumstances   It is illegal         Waterboarding clearly runs afoul of three federal statutes     the 1994 anti torture statute  the Military Commissions Act  and the Detainee Treatment Act     and it is inconsistent with our obligations under Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions         In his answers to questions from the Judiciary Committee  Judge Mukasey refused to state whether waterboarding constitutes torture under U S  law    Under the federal anti torture statute adopted in 1994  18 U S C     2340   an act is torture if it is specifically intended to cause    severe physical or mental pain or suffering      The statute defines    severe mental pain and suffering    as mental harm caused by  among other things     threat of imminent death      Pouring water over a detainee   s face to create the sensation of drowning is intended to threaten imminent death       In questions for the record of an August 2006 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing  Senator Durbin asked each of the Judge Advocates General  JAGs  of the Marine Corps  Air Force  Army  and Navy whether  in their personal view     the use of a wet towel and dripping water to induce the misperception of a drowning  i e   waterboarding   was  legal      The answer from each of the JAGs was an unequivocal    No      The Marine Corps JAG responded to Senator Durbin    Threatening a detainee with imminent death  to include drowning  is torture under 18 USC    2340     the anti torture statute    Similarly  the Air Force JAG stated     An interrogation technique that is specifically intended to cause severe mental suffering involving a threat of imminent death by asphyxiation is torture under 18 U S C    2340     And the Army JAG responded     inducing the misperception of drowning as an interrogation technique is not legal            Whether the practice of mock drowning is legal is a question that our nation   s top military lawyers had no problem answering   But the nominee for Attorney General says that it depends on    circumstances     it could be    yes     it could be    no          The U S  Navy   s Survival  Evasion  Resistance  and Escape  SERE  School trains our troops  whose dangerous assignments leave them susceptible to being captured  to resist and survive abusive tactics that might be used by the enemy   Waterboarding is one of the tactics that troops are exposed to at Navy SERE school   Listen to how a former master instructor and chief of training at the Navy   s SERE school described waterboarding in an October 31  2007 article in the New York Daily News     Waterboarding is slow motion suffocation with enough time to contemplate the inevitability of blackout and expiration  Usually the person goes into hysterics on the board   For the uninitiated  it is horrifying to watch   If it goes wrong  it can lead straight to terminal hypoxia   meaning  the loss of all oxygen to the cells      As he put it     waterboarding is a torture technique   without a doubt  There is no way to sugarcoat it            A U S  federal court has concluded that mock drowning constitutes torture   The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals examined an interrogation technique used by the Philippine military under Ferdinand Marcos whereby    all of  the victim   s  limbs were shackled to a cot and a towel was placed over his nose and mouth  his interrogators then poured water down his nostrils so that he felt as though he was drowning      The court referred to this practice as    water torture    and found against those responsible for this and other illegal acts       By contrast  Judge Mukasey not only refuses to state that waterboarding is torture  he also refuses to say whether it constitutes    cruel or inhuman treatment     which is illegal under the Military Commissions Act of 2006         Congress enacted the Military Commissions Act in the wake of Abu Ghraib scandal   The statute bans interrogations tactics that constitute    cruel or inhuman treatment     which it defines as any act generally intended to cause    serious mental or physical pain and suffering           Medical experts who have treated and observed the survivors of water torture have described the physical and psychological severity of the practice and its long term effect   Dr  Allan Keller  Associate Professor of Medicine at New York University  NYU  School of Medicine and Director of the Bellevue NYU Program for Survivors of Torture  recently testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee that a person subjected to the waterboard     gags and chokes   and  the terror of imminent death is pervasive  with all of the physiologic and psychological responses expected  including an intense stress response  manifested by tachycardia  rapid heart beat and gasping for breath  There is a real risk of death from actually drowning or suffering a heart attack or damage to the lungs from inhalation of water       Dr  Keller put it plainly  the    clinical experience and data from the medical literature are clear and unequivocal  These techniques can cause significant and long lasting psychological and often physical pain and harm            It is clear that waterboarding involves    serious    physical or mental pain or suffering and therefore constitutes illegal    cruel or inhuman treatment    under the Military Commissions Act   Yet  in response to questions from Senator Kennedy and Senator Biden  Judge Mukasey would not say whether waterboarding is    cruel or inhuman    under this legal standard        When asked whether the practice of mock drowning on detainees was    cruel  inhuman  or degrading     which is a violation Detainee Treatment Act  Judge Mukasey would not respond to the question  simply giving his stock answer that his analysis depends on the    circumstances          Congress passed the Detainee Treatment Act in 2005 to make clear that inhumane treatment is illegal   The Detainee Treatment Act prohibits subjecting any detainee in U S  Government custody or control  wherever held  to    cruel  inhuman  or degrading treatment or punishment      Those terms were defined to restrict any conduct that would constitute cruel  unusual  and inhumane treatment or punishment prohibited by the U S  Constitution  which includes conduct that    shocks the conscience            There can be no question that mock drowning    shocks the conscience    and rises to the level of    cruel  inhuman  or degrading treatment or punishment    under the Detainee Treatment Act         I asked Judge Mukasey whether the practice of mock drowning on detainees was    inhumane     which would be a violation of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions   Judge Mukasey would not respond to that question  again giving his stock answer that his analysis depends on the    circumstances      Regardless of what the President   s recent Executive Order would suggest  the humane standard of Common Article 3 has never varied depending on the type of information in someone   s possession or the purpose behind the acts           The Army Field Manual on Intelligence  which sets standards for military interrogations consistent with the Geneva Conventions and with U S  law that prohibits    torture or cruel  inhuman  or degrading treatment or punishment    explicitly bans certain coercive techniques including    waterboarding          Throughout history America has condemned waterboarding by seeking prosecution of enemies who have used the technique on American servicemembers   Following the Second World War  U S  military commissions and international tribunals prosecuted individuals who had used waterboarding  or similar forms of water torture on civilians and Allied forces   The U S  military commissions in the Pacific Theater explicitly held that the    water cure    was torture in prosecuting cases related to the mistreatment of captured U S  bomber crews  The U S  Military Commission at Yokohama  Japan also tried four Japanese defendants for torture  including water torture  of American and Allied forces  Each of the defendants was convicted and sentenced to twenty years hard labor       Would Judge Mukasey find it acceptable if U S  soldiers were subjected to mock drowning by our enemies   Would he say that its acceptability depends on the    circumstances      Would Judge Mukasey say that he needed to know the motives of our enemies before saying that our soldiers who endured waterboarding had been tortured or subject to inhumane treatment   Would he distinguish between someone who waterboarded our troops to elicit information as contrasted to someone who used the technique on our troops for sadistic purposes       Judge Mukasey needs to be clear that waterboarding is illegal for the sake of protecting our men and women in uniform from abuse should they ever be captured   Judge Mukasey has not been clear and if he is confirmed to head our Justice Department  it will be America signaling moral ambiguity about what is unambiguously torture and inhumane       In fact  the United States has prosecuted its own servicemembers who have used waterboarding and similar water tortures during interrogations   During the American intervention in the Philippines  in 1902  a military court rejected Major Edwin Glenn   s defense of    military necessity    and convicted him for using water torture on a captured insurgent    During the Vietnam War  a soldier participated in water torture which was captured in photos and published in the Washington Post on January 21  1968   According to the Washington Post  the soldier was court martialed for his involvement in the practice       U S  veterans who served as interrogators in the Second World War recently discussed how proud they were that they were able to obtain vital information by using skill  not torture  and by treating a dangerous enemy with    respect and justice      In an article in the Washington Post last month  one veteran proudly exclaimed     During the many interrogations  I never laid hands on anyone   We extracted information in a battle of the wits   I   m proud to say I never compromised my humanity          I had hoped Judge Mukasey would stand with that veteran and stand up for American values   But despite the clear law and history  Judge Mukasey engaged in legalisms and obfuscation  playing into the negative image that others project about the U S     that we apply double standards         This kind of obfuscation tarnishes America   s image  which has a negative impact on our ability to organize and maintain alliances to achieve national goals   As Steven Kull  the director of the Program on International Policy Attitudes  stated     The thing that comes up repeatedly is not just anger about Iraq   The common theme is hypocrisy   The reaction tends to be     You were a champion of a certain set of rules  Now you are breaking your own rules            Purposeful ambiguity about the legality of waterboarding and the other coercive interrogation techniques he was asked about is at the center of Judge Mukasey   s confirmation  just as it is at the center of how we are viewed in the world   That ambiguity is untenable and unacceptable in the person who  if confirmed  will symbolize America   s concept of justice before the world   For these reasons  I oppose Judge Mukasey   s nomination to be Attorney General
