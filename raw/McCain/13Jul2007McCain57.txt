                                                                                                                         SENATOR McCAIN ADDRESSES CHRISTIANS UNITED FOR ISRAEL July 17  2007 WASHINGTON  DC     U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today addressed the national convention of Christians United for Israel in Washington  DC  The remarks as prepared for delivery are below       Thank you for the honor of speaking before this gathering  and thank you for the work you do in support of the State of Israel  Your efforts are needed today more than ever  as it is harder to think of a time in recent memory when Israel   s national security has faced so many varied challenges       The Jewish state has  of course  experienced tough times before     indeed  they have perhaps been the norm rather than the exception  When one thinks back over the conflicts     1948  the Six Day War  Yom Kippur  Lebanon  the first Gulf War  two intifadas and Lebanon again     it is clear that Israel has been challenged more  in less time  than any nation on earth  Survival in the face of such trials would be impressive  flourishing would seem out of the question       Yet Israel has thrived  I would like to believe that Israel   s success has been aided by America  Israel   s natural partner and ally  and by its supporters here and the world over     several thousand of which are here today  But the tests continue   with Hamas and Hezbollah  in the anti Semitism so pervasive in the Arab press  in the restive violence in Iraq and elsewhere  and in the vile threats issued routinely by the Iranian president       But Israel will survive  Just as it has thrived in the face of armies and terrorists  just as it has prospered in the most dangerous neighborhood on earth  so will it succeed in the face of today   s threats  There will always  always be an Israel      And just as there will always be a proud  strong Israel  so too will there always be a close and enduring U S  Israel relationship  When it comes to the defense of Israel  we simply cannot compromise  In view of the increased threats to Israeli security  American support for Israel should intensify     to include providing needed military equipment and technology and ensuring that Israel maintains its qualitative military edge  Israel   s enemies are too numerous  its margin of error too small  and our shared interests and values too great for any other position       Israel   s strength will be put to the test  The world s chief state sponsor of international terrorism  Iran  defines itself by hostility to Israel and the United States  It is simply tragic that millennia of proud Persian history have culminated in a government today that cannot be counted among those of the world   s civilized nations  When the president of Iran calls for Israel to be wiped off of the map  or asks for a world without Zionism  or suggests that Israel   s Jewish population return to Europe  or calls the Holocaust a myth  it is clear that we are dealing with an evil man and a very dangerous regime        Tehran s continued pursuit of nuclear weapons clearly poses an unacceptable risk  Protected by a nuclear arsenal  Iran would feel unconstrained to sponsor terrorist attacks against any perceived enemy  Its flouting of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty would render that regime obsolete  and could induce Turkey  Egypt  Saudi Arabia and others to reassess their defense posture  Moderate Gulf states would have to accommodate the new reality  and the world would live  indefinitely  with the possibility that Tehran might pass nuclear materials or weapons to one of its allied terrorist networks  Coupled with its ballistic missile arsenal  an Iranian nuclear capability would pose an immediate and existential threat to the State of Israel      UN Security Council action is required to impose progressively tougher political and economic sanctions  Should the Security Council continue to drag its feet  the U S  must lead a group of like minded countries in imposing multilateral sanctions outside the UN framework  Iran   s need to import refined gasoline  to cite one example  suggests an important vulnerability  And countries such as China and Malaysia  which have signed deals to develop Iranian gas fields  and Russia  which provides weapons systems to Tehran  should know that Iran will be a critical element in American   s bilateral relations with each nation  In the meantime  the U S  should immediately investigate whether any of these deals violate the terms of last year   s Iran Freedom Support Act      The U S  should also privatize the sanctions effort by launching a disinvestment campaign  By persuading individuals  pension funds  and financial institutions to divest from companies doing business with Iran  we can isolate and delegitimize a hostile government  We will also  as we did with the South Africa disinvestment campaign  increase the debate inside the country about whether the present course serves the interests of the Iranian people or merely those of a misguided elite  Americans and all proponents of freedom need to reassure the millions of Iranians who aspire to self determination that we support their longing for freedom and democracy      And every option must remain on the table  Military action isn   t our preference  It remains  as it always must  the last option  We have some way to go diplomatically before we need to contemplate other measures  But it is a simple observation of reality that there is only one thing worse than a military solution  and that  my friends  is a nuclear armed Iran  The regime must understand that it cannot win a showdown with the world       Similarly  the leadership of Hamas must be isolated  The Palestinian people are ill served by a terrorist led government that refuses to recognize Israel   s right to exist  refuses to renounce violence  and refuses to acknowledge prior peace commitments  The United States cannot have normal relations with such a government  one that deliberately targets innocent Israeli civilians in an attempt to terrorize the Jewish population       The recent talks between the Israeli government and the government led by President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank are encouraging  and the United States should support this effort  We also must ensure that Israel   s people can live in safety until a Palestinian leadership truly committed to peace emerges  No moral nation     neither Israel nor America     can allow terrorists to chart the political course of its people       And to speak of terrorism is also to speak of Hezbollah  Israel   s chance for enduring peace with Lebanon resides in a government that has a monopoly on authority within its country  That means no independent militias  no Hezbollah fighters  no weapons and equipment flowing to Hezbollah  Yet neither the Lebanese Army nor the international force there is prepared or willing to take on Hezbollah  So long as that is the case  the current pause is likely to enable Hezbollah to regroup  reconstitute  and rearm  There is one bottom line  to achieve lasting peace  sooner or later  one way or another  Hezbollah must be disarmed       Now let me turn briefly to Iraq  We have made a great many mistakes in this war  and both Baghdad and Washington remain divided about how to correct them  The situation in Iraq is very difficult  and the temptation is to wash our hands of a messy situation  To follow this impulse  however  portends catastrophe  for Iraq  Israel  and the United States       Because a precipitous American withdrawal risks all out civil war and the emergence of a failed state in the heart of the Middle East  inviting intervention from Iraq   s neighbors and the potential for region wide conflict  we must do all in our power to prevail  This means supporting General Petraeus as he leads our troops in counterinsurgency operations designed to clear areas of terrorists and bring security to the population  It also means pressing the Maliki government to make political progress  which has been sorely lacking  The Iraqi government must seize the opportunity that has been provided it by the    surge    in U S  forces and make bold steps on reconciliation  It will not come around again       Preventing Iraq from falling into the hands of terrorists and extremists is only natural for the United States  and springs from the same interests and values that compel our close relationship with the state of Israel  Violent Islamic extremists would have us believe that there is only one acceptable religious practice  and that those who diverge from it are not entitled to life or liberty  They are wrong  very  very wrong       If America stands for anything  it stands for the freedom to follow our own minds and hearts  to determine our own relationship with God  I did not realize just how precious this freedom is until it was taken away  As some in this audience may know  I spent several years as a prisoner of war  a time when all my freedoms were rescinded  And yet it was my very faith in a Supreme Being that sustained me and strengthened me while at the hands of my captors       Our founders built in this nation an amazing thing     a democracy that guarantees the right of every citizen to worship God in the way that they choose  We must protect that freedom here in our own country by ensuring that judges do not legislate from the bench to remove religion from the public squares of our communities  And we must support its expansion abroad by standing with those whom  because of their religion and their values  come under threat       It is evident that I am speaking  once again  of Israel  The bond between America and Israel is not just a strategic one  though that is important  The more profound tie between our two countries is a moral one  We are two democracies whose alliance is forged in our common values  To be proudly pro American and pro Israeli is not to hold conflicting loyalties  It is about defending the principles that both countries hold dear  That is why today I stand as I believe so many of you do  a Christian  proudly pro American and proudly pro Israel                                                        July 2007 Press Releases           Browse by
