Washington D C   Today  U S  Senator McCain  R AZ  delivered the following statement on floor of the Senate regarding his co sponsorship of an amendment to the Water Resources Development Bill  S  728  calling for an independent system to review Army Corps projects  Mr  President  I am pleased to join Senators Feingold  Carper  Lieberman  and Jeffords in sponsoring an amendment to establish a truly independent system for conducting peer review of certain Army Corps projects   As my colleges know  the Corps has come under intense scrutiny by government watchdog agencies and taxpayer groups  including the Government Accountability Office  GAO  and the National Academy of Sciences  Investigation after investigation into the Corps project review practices have revealed serious problems with the quality  objectivity  and credibility of the Corps when reporting on the economic and environmental feasibility of proposed water projects  One GAO report concluded in 2006 that the Corps planning studies were fraught with errors  mistakes  and miscalculations  and used invalid assumptions and outdated data  The same GAO report cited several examples of the Corps failure to properly analyze projects  These include  The Sacramento Flood Protection Project  According to the GAO  the Corps did not fully analyze likely cost increases for the Sacramento Flood Protection Project or report cost overruns to Congress in a timely manner  The GAO found that the estimated cost of the project originally totaled about  114 million  but increased to about  500 million by 2002  By the time the Corps reported theses cost increases to Congress in 2002  it had already spent or planned to spend more than double its original estimated cost  GAO also discovered that the Corps incorrectly counted the number of properties protected by the project by almost 20  and incorrectly valued these properties  The Delaware Deepening Project  The GAO found that the Corps substantially overstated the projected economic benefits of the Delaware River channel deepening project  Whereas the Corps estimated the benefits to be  40 1 million per year in 1998  the GAO projected only  13 3 million per year  The GAO urged the Corps to reanalyze the project  which later revealed it could be built for  56 million less than what the Corps previously estimated   The Oregon Inlet Jetty Project  According to the GAO  the Corps analysis of the Oregon Inlet Jetty Project  issued in 2001  failed to consider alternatives to the proposed project  used outdated data to estimate benefits to fishing trawlers  and did not account for the effects on smaller fishing vessels  The estimated economic benefit of this project was originally estimated to be  2 million annually by the Corps  but was revised to  300 000 annually under GAOs review  The Corps subsequently canceled this project   Mr  President  it may surprise you to know that the GAO discovered that the last two projects were subjected to the Corps existing organizational review process  but the Corps still failed to catch their mistakes  Following years of criticism by oversight agencies  the Corps  in May 2005  adopted guidelines for conducting external reviews of projects  At first glance  the Corps process might seem reasonable and comprehensive until given a closer look  The current guidelines give the Corps virtually complete discretion to decide what projects should be reviewed from outside the Corps  The so called peer reviewers themselves are selected by the Corps  and in some circumstances  can even be Corps employees  According to the American Society of Civil Engineers  Corps officials have identified approximately 25 engineering studies as eligible for outside peer review since the peer review guidelines were enacted over a year ago  but the Corps has not been able to point to any study where an external review was actually carried out  Mr  President  because of the Corps lousy track record when it comes to project reviews  this amendment is designed to ensure independent review for certain Corps projects those that are costly  controversial  or critical to public safety  More specifically  Corps studies would be subject to peer review if  the project cost more than  40 million  the Governor of an affected state requests a review  a federal agency with statutory authority to review a project finds that it will have significant adverse impact  or  the Secretary of the Army determines that the project is controversial  The timing of the review is flexible  but the duration is strictly limited in order to not delay the process  Reviewers will be able to consider all the date  facts  and models used  Finally the amendment establishes an independent safety assurance review for flood control projects where the public safety could be at risk should the project fail something recommended by the Senate Homeland Security Committees report on Hurricane Katrina   Mr  President  we cannot allow wasteful spending and faulty planning to continue to impact the budgets of our nations critical water projects  Given our budget constraints  its only reasonable that we ensure appropriate fiscal accountability within the Corps  and that means looking beyond the Corps   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment                                                       July 2006 Press Releases
