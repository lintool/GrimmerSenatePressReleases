                                                                                                                         MCCAIN CALLS FOR MORE TRANSPARENCY IN FEDERAL FUNDING July 18  2006 Washington D C     Today  Senator McCain  R AZ  delivered the following statement on the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006  S  2590  before the Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management  Government Information  and International Security   Mr  Chairman  thank you for holding this hearing today  and thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak in support of S  2590  the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act  I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this bill and I am confident its passage would go a long way in helping to reign in federal spending   This bill would direct the Office of Management and Budget  OMB  to create a searchable database    available to the public at no cost    that lists each entity receiving federal funding  The website would show the amount of federal funds the entity received in each of the last 10 fiscal years  an itemized breakdown of each transaction  the location of the entity  and a unique identifier for the entity and its parent entity   As you know  Mr  Chairman  this bill has received support from both sides of the aisle and from a bipartisan coalition of over 75 organizations  In my view  the reason for such broad support is simple  people are beginning to realize that the only way to control spending and ensure accountability is to let the American people see exactly how their money is being spent   Critics of this bill have suggested that the requirements of the legislation are too burdensome and that it would be too costly and take too much work to collect and post this data  I don t buy that argument  Mr  Chairman  OMB already maintains the data necessary for this website  and the technology clearly exists to implement the requirements of this bill  More importantly  the cost of the waste  fraud  and abuse that can remain hidden in the system without such a disclosure is much more costly to the American taxpayer than the implementation of this bill   Our nation s future economic success rests in part on the decisions we make today    and the ones we put off  We are facing some dire fiscal challenges in the days ahead  According to the Government Accountability Office  GAO   the unfunded federal financial burden  such as public debt  future Social Security  Medicare  and Medicaid payments  totals more than  46 trillion  or  156 000 per man  woman and child  According to David Walker  the head of the GAO  for a family  this burden is like having a  750 000 mortgage    and no house  But  instead of fixing the problem  and fixing it will not be easy  we ve only succeeded in making it bigger  more unstable  more complicated  and much  much more expensive   Time and time again  attempts have been made to slow the growth of federal spending and time and time again those efforts have failed  We need a new approach  I ve long believed that real budgetary reforms won t happen until the American people demand greater accountability for how their tax dollars are being spent  This bill could be just the tool necessary to put us on the track to real accountability and reform  When American workers look at their pay stubs each month and see what has been sent to Washington  they ought to be able to learn exactly how that money is being spent  When they see that we are spending millions on bridges to nowhere  teapot museums  and zoos    they ll demand accountability from their elected officials  Mr  Chairman    I m sure of it  A recent editorial on Tennessean com stated that Congress needs to open up and shed light on its business in many ways  With an accessible database of grants and contracts  the public may see spending it despises  and it may see spending that it approves of  down to the last penny  The only reason to oppose compiling the information for public use is if the government has something to hide  I am hopeful that a searchable database of federal spending will help reduce the ever increasing number of earmarks in the annual appropriations bills  The growth in earmarked funding during the past 12 years has been staggering  In 1994  there were 4 126 earmarks  In 2005  there were 15 877   an increase of nearly 400 percent  The largest number of earmarks have occurred in the last three years    2004  2005  and 2006  Now  let s consider the level of funding associated with those earmarks  The amount of earmarked funding increased from  23 2 billion in 1994 to  64 billion in FY 2006  Remarkably  it rose by 34 percent from 2005 to 2006  even though the actual number of earmarks decreased slightly  Earmarked dollars have doubled just since 2000  and more than tripled in the last 10 years  This is wrong and disgraceful and we urgently need to make some serious  meaningful changes   Mr  Chairman  we simply must start making some very tough decisions around here if we are serious about improving our fiscal future  We need to be thinking about the future of America and the future generations who are going to be paying the tab for our continued spending  It is simply not fiscally responsible for us to continue with wasteful and unnecessary spending  while passing along good deals to the special interests and their lobbyists  We have had ample opportunities to tighten our belts in this town in recent years  and we have taken a pass each and every time  We can t put off the inevitable any longer  The American people have the right to know how and where their tax dollars are being spent   Thank you again for holding this hearing today and for allowing me the opportunity to share my views                                                    July 2006 Press Releases           Browse by
