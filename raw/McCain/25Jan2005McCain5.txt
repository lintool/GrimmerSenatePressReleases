                                                                                                                         STATEMENT BY SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN ON PROFESSIONAL BOXING AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2005 January 25  2005 Senator John McCain  R AZ  submitted the following statement to the Congressional Record on the introduction of the Professional Boxing Amendments Act of 2005    Mr  President  today I am pleased to be joined by Senators Stevens and Dorgan in introducing the Professional Boxing Amendments Act of 2005  This legislation is virtually identical to a measure approved unanimously by the Senate last year  I remain committed to moving the Professional Boxing Amendments Act through the Senate and I trust that my colleagues will once again vote favorably on this important legislation  Simply put  this legislation would better protect professional boxing from the fraud  corruption  and ineffective regulation that have plagued the sport for far too many years  and that have devastated physically and financially many of our nation s professional boxers    For almost a decade  Congress has made efforts to improve the sport of professional boxing  and for very good reason  With rare exception  professional boxers come from the lowest rung on our economic ladder  They are the least educated and most exploited athletes in our nation  The Professional Boxing Safety Act of 1996 and the Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act of 2000 established uniform health and safety standards for professional boxers  as well as basic protections for boxers against the sometimes coercive  exploitative  and unethical business practices of promoters  managers  and sanctioning organizations  But further action is needed    Mr  President  the Professional Boxing Amendments Act would strengthen existing Federal boxing law by improving the basic health and safety standards for professional boxers  establishing a centralized medical registry to be used by local commissions to protect boxers  reducing the arbitrary practices of sanctioning organizations  and enhancing the uniformity and basic standards for professional boxing contracts  Most importantly  this legislation would establish a Federal regulatory entity to oversee professional boxing and set basic uniform standards for certain aspects of the sport    Current Federal boxing law has improved to some extent the state of professional boxing  However  I remain concerned  as do many others  that the sport remains at risk  Some State and tribal boxing commissions still to this day do not comply with Federal boxing law  and there is still a troubling lack of enforcement of the law by both Federal and State officials   Indeed  professional boxing remains the only major sport in the United States that does not have a strong  centralized association  league  or other regulatory body to establish and enforce uniform rules and practices  Because a powerful few benefit greatly from the current system of patchwork compliance and enforcement of Federal boxing law  a national self regulating organization  though preferable to Federal government oversight  is not a realistic option    Ineffective and inconsistent oversight of professional boxing has contributed to the continuing scandals  controversies  unethical practices  and unnecessary deaths in the sport  These problems have led many in professional boxing to conclude that the only solution is an effective and accountable Federal boxing commission  The Professional Boxing Amendments Act would create such an entity    Mr  President  this bill would establish the United States Boxing Commission  USBC or Commission   The Commission would be responsible for protecting the health  safety  and general interests of professional boxers  The USBC would also be responsible for ensuring uniformity  fairness  and integrity in professional boxing  More specifically  the Commission would administer Federal boxing law and coordinate with other Federal regulatory agencies to ensure that this law is enforced  oversee all professional boxing matches in the United States  and work with the boxing industry and local commissions to improve the safety  integrity  and professionalism of professional boxing in the United States    The USBC would also license boxers  promoters  managers  and sanctioning organizations  The Commission would have the authority to revoke such a license for violations of Federal boxing law  to stop unethical or illegal conduct  to protect the health and safety of a boxer  or if the revocation is otherwise in the public interest    Mr  President  it is important to state clearly and plainly for the record that the purpose of the USBC is not to interfere with the daily operations of State and tribal boxing commissions  Instead  the Commission would work in consultation with local commissions  and it would only exercise its authority when reasonable grounds exist for such intervention  In point of fact  the Professional Boxing Amendments Act states explicitly that it would not prohibit any boxing commission from exercising any of its powers  duties  or functions with respect to the regulation or supervision of professional boxing to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of Federal boxing law    Let there be no doubt  however  of the very basic and pressing need in professional boxing for a Federal boxing commission  The establishment of the USBC would address that need    The problems that plague the sport of professional boxing undermine the credibility of the sport in the eyes of the public and  more importantly  compromise the safety of boxers  The Professional Boxing Amendments Act provides an effective approach to curbing these problems  I again urge my colleagues to support this legislation    Mr  President  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this bill be printed in the RECORD at this point     end                                             January 2005
