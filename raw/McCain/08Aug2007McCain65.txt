                                                                                                                         SENATOR McCAIN ADDRESSES THE NATIONAL GUARD ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED STATES August 27  2007 WASHINGTON  DC  U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today addressed the National Guard Association of the United States conference in San Juan  Puerto Rico  The remarks  as prepared for delivery  are as follows    Good morning  and thank you for the honor of being here with you for this 129th General Conference  I am proud to address such a distinguished group of patriots    I am here  in part  to say thank you for your service and your sacrifice on behalf of our beloved country  Every American who understands the true value of freedom  and the price that must be paid to preserve it  owes an eternal debt of gratitude to each you and to all of the brave and honorable citizen soldiers you are privileged to lead  The men and women of the National Guard are a national treasure    I was blessed to have been born into a family who made their living at sea in defense of our security and ideals  My grandfather was a naval aviator  my father a submariner  Their respect for me was one of the great ambitions of my life  And so it was nearly pre ordained that I would find a place in my familys profession  and that occupation would one day take me to war    Such was not the case for many of you  Your ambitions might not have led you to war  the honors you sought were not kept hidden on battlefields  Many of you were citizen soldiers  You answered the call when it came  took up arms and served for your countrys sake  and fought because you believed Americas security was as much your responsibility as it was the professional soldiers  And when you came home  you built a better a country than the one you inherited   I do not mean to dismiss the virtues of the professional soldier  I consider my inclusion in their ranks to be one of the great honors of my life  The Navy was and still remains the world I know best and love most   The world has changed dramatically since September 11  2001  Today  the National Guards role resembles  in many respects  the role it performed in World War II  when Guard units fought in every theater and every major campaign    Units such as Company A of the 116th Infantry Regimentthe famed Bedford Boys of the Virginia National Guardthat spearheaded the allied assault on Omaha Beach  June 6  1944  Prior to 9 11  a lot of us didnt always fully appreciate the power and potential of the Guard  and what it might one day be called upon to do  But my friends  we understand it now  Times have changedwe all understand that now   Today  thousands of National Guard soldiers and airmen once again fight alongside their active component comrades on every battlefield in the war against militant Islam  From the mountains of Afghanistan to the back alleys of Iraq  Guard and Reserve personnel are engaged in every aspect of this conflict   Todays National Guard soldiers and airmen  together with the Reserve forces  are the citizen soldiers of the next Great Generation  You are the role models of freedom  who bravely set aside self interest  and forgo the comforts of home  the economic security of your jobs and enterprises  and the company of your families to undertake the hard work of freedom  to do your part in preserving our precious gift of liberty  protecting our cherished values  and securing the life and property of fellow human beings  often by risking your own    The men and women of the National Guard represent the very best of what it means to be an American and what our country is truly all aboutfree people of every race  creed  color  and ethnic background  who regard it as their sacred duty not simply to indulge in the rights and privileges of citizenship  but to answer its obligations    No matter the danger to our security or safety  at home or abroad  whether from the violent foes of freedom or the turbulent forces of nature  wherever and whenever America has called  the National Guard has answered  You have always been ready  You have always been there   For everyone in the military todaywhether you are Guard  Active  or Reservethese are difficult times  We are a nation at war  and we have asked of our men and women of the armed forces an almost unprecedented level of commitment and sacrifice  Extended deployments and back to back combat tours have become the standard rather than the exception    In the face of these demands  the distinction between the Guard and Active forcesa distinction that once was so clearis now virtually undetectable  In 2005  Army National Guard brigades made up more than 50  of the combat units in Iraq  Not since WWII have we asked so much of the Guard  not only overseas but at home where the Guard must continue to fulfill its critical duties securing the homeland from attack  and responding to emergencies that threaten lives and property almost every day   Fortunately for America  today the men and women of the National Guard  are cut from the same patriotic cloth as their predecessors who answered the call at Concord and Bunker Hill  Gettysburg and Cold Harbor  the Argonne Forrest  and the beaches of Normandy   They are men like Master Sergeant Keary Miller of the 123rd Special Tactics Squadron of the Kentucky Air Guardwho  in March 2002  boarded a CH 47 in an attempt to rescue two stranded American servicemen from a mountainous area of Afghanistan swarming with al Qeada and Taliban forces  The helicopter took heavy fire and crashed  injuring several on board  Ultimately  seven American lives were lost  but many more were saved  thanks to the courage of Master Sergeant Keary Miller   With total disregard for his own safety  Master Sergeant Miller helped establish a defensive perimeter  then tended the wounded  protected them from enemy fire  and established MEDEVAC collection points  But that was not enough for this Fighting Kentuckian  This was a gunfight for survival  and Master Sergeant Miller ensured the success of his team by gathering up ammunition and distributing it among those still able to fight  making sure everyones weapon was replenished and no one was left defenseless  Master Sergeant Miller was credited with saving the lives of ten gravely wounded Americans   These were the actions of an American patriot  a citizen soldier and true hero who epitomized the creed of the Air Force para rescueman That Others May Live  and one who followed the motto of all Bluegrass State warriorsto Fight Like Kentuckians   The world in which many of us served in the past was a dangerous one  but more stable than the world today  It was a world where we confronted a massive  organized threat to our security  Our enemy was evil  but not irrational  And for all the suffering endured by captive nations  for all the fear of global nuclear war  it was a world made fairly predictable by a stable balance of power until our steadfastness and patience yielded an historic victory for our security and ideals  That world is gone  and please dont mistake my reminiscence as an indication that I miss it  If Im nostalgic for it at all  it is only an old mans nostalgia for the time where he misspent his youth  That world  after all  had much cruelty and terror  some of which it was our fate to witness personally   Today  we glimpse the prospect of another  better world  in which all people might someday share in the blessings and responsibilities of freedom  But we also face a threat and a long war to defeat it that is as difficult and in many respects more destabilizing than any challenge we have ever faced  We confront an enemy that so despises us and modernity itself that they would use any means  unleash any terror  cause the most unimaginable suffering to harm us  and to destroy the world we have tried throughout our history to build    As we meet  in Iraq and Afghanistan  American soldiers  Marines  sailors and airmen are fighting bravely and tenaciously in battles that are as dangerous  difficult and consequential as the great battles of our armed forces storied past  As we all know  the war in Iraq has not gone well  and the American people have grown sick and tired of it  I understand that  of course  I  too  have been made sick at heart by the many mistakes made by civilian and military commanders and the terrible price we have paid for them  But we cannot react to these mistakes by embracing a course of action that will be an even greater mistake  a mistake of colossal historical proportions  which will  and I am as sure of this as I am of anything  seriously endanger the country I have served all my adult life    In the coming month we will face a fork in the road  We can pursue our opportunity for victory in Iraq  strengthen our hand in the larger war against Islamic extremists  and make our nation more secure  Or we can fold our tents  embolden our enemies  throw a region into instability  and increase the risks faced on our home soil  Which way requires greater leadership  I plan to lead the fight in September on the floor of the United States Senate to support our troops and in support of victory and against a plan for defeat    We have new commanders in Iraq  and they are following a counterinsurgency strategy that I have advocated from the beginning of this war  which makes the most effective use of our strength and doesnt strengthen the tactics of our enemy  This new battle plan is succeeding where our previous tactics failed  Although the outcome remains uncertain  we must give General Petraeus and the Americans he has the honor to command adequate time to salvage from the wreckage of our past mistakes a measure of stability for Iraq and the Middle East  and a more secure future for the American people  To concede defeat now would strengthen al Qaeda  empower Iran and other hostile powers in the Middle East  unleash a full scale civil war in Iraq that could quite possibly provoke genocide there  and destabilize the entire region as neighboring powers come to the aid of their favored factions  The consequences would threaten us for years  and I am certain would eventually draw us into a wider and more difficult war that would impose even greater sacrifices on us    Our defeat in Iraq would be catastrophic  not just for Iraq  but for us  and I cannot be complicit in it  I will do whatever I can  whether I am effective or not  to help avert it  That is all I can offer my country  It is not much compared to the sacrifices made by Americans who have volunteered to shoulder a rifle and fight this war for us  I know that and am humbled by it  But though my duty is neither dangerous nor onerous  it compels me nonetheless to say to my fellow Americans  as long as we have a chance to succeed we must try to succeed    I have many responsibilities to the American people  and I try to take them all seriously  But I have one responsibility that outweighs all the others  and that is to use whatever meager talents I possess  and every resource God has granted me to protect the security of this great and good nation from all enemies foreign and domestic  And that I intend to do  even if I must stand athwart popular opinion  I will attempt to convince as many of my countrymen as I can that we must show even greater patience  though our patience is nearly exhausted so we can defeat our enemies  That is how I construe my responsibility to my country  That is how I construed it yesterday  It is how I construe it today  It is how I will construe it tomorrow  I do not know how I could choose any other course   The new security environment in which we live will continue to pose great challenges  and require that we use all elements of national power to defeat radicalism  The National Guard will play a vital role in this multi dimensional effort  precisely because its citizen soldiers and airmen bring such a wide range of skills and capacities to the force   As we go forward  America must make a new and lasting commitment to our National Guarda commitment that will ensure the force is properly manned  trained  led  and equipped to undertake the growing scope of missions we ask of you both at home and abroad   Such commitment must begin with our political leadership recognizing the sheer magnitude of what we ask Guard units to accomplish with a force comprised primarily of part time soldiers and airmen    Such commitment means providing sufficient end strengths in the Active  Guard and Reserve components consistent with the workload imposed on our military  We must do a better job of following the guidelines regarding the frequency and duration of deployments  Failure to do so abuses the trust of those who serve  and is a national disgrace   It means ensuring that the Guard has the proper equipment with which to train and deploy  We must never  never  ask our young men and women to go into harms way without the equipment and training they need to do their job effectively and safelywhether the enemy they face is a military force  terrorist cell  pandemic disease  earthquake  fire  or flood    It means that our nations leaders must set wiser priorities in the allocation of national resources  The Congress must stop funding bridges to nowhere and thousands of other pork barrel projects while we shortchange our service members and fail to provide what they need to defend our nation   It means getting rid of Defense Department policies  practices  and customs that fail to promote a seamless total force based on cooperation  jointness  and the mutual respect that all components have earned with their blood and bravery  It means establishing a new compact with our Guard and Reserve component personnel to ensure they have the pay they deserve  the career opportunities they merit  and the level of service that befits their time  capability  and need  It means making certain that our Guard and Reserve members  and their families  receive the proper health care they deserve and have been promised  It means guaranteeing that all injured service members are treated with equal care and dignity   And  my friends  it means a national leadership that respects and treats our governors and Adjutant Generals as partners in national and homeland security policymaking  rather than as impediments and intruders  As far as Im concerned part of that essential effort must be granting the Chief of the National Guard Bureau the fourth star that the position merits  and updating the charter of the Bureau to align it with the scope and importance of its mission today    Achieving these imperatives will require breaking old paradigms  shedding outdated thinking  and understanding the new capabilities that are so vital in the modern security environment  It will require less partisanship and greater political will  Above all  it demands strong leadership at all levels of government and the military    From great challenges  emerge great opportunities  Ours is a time of unprecedented challenge  With it comes the opportunity to make our country safer  the world better  and the future brighter  We can do this  We can seize this opportunity for our good and the good of our children  but only if we exercise the resolve that America has always demonstrated in momentous times when our security and the prospects of the worlds future hung in the balance    I would like to close as I beganby saying thank you  To the National Guardsmen who today will walk combat patrols in Iraq and Afghanistan  to those who will fly missions in support of our deployed forces  to those engaged back home in humanitarian efforts to relieve suffering  and to all of you who know what it means to stand the long night watches  thank you  You understand both the valueand the price  of freedom  You are the best among us    In whatever capacity Providence grants that I serve my country I pledge to you my undying fidelity to the cause to which you devote your livesthe safety and security of Americaand a National Guard that will always be ready  and always be there    Thank you                                                  August 2007 Press Releases           Browse by
