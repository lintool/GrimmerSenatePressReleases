                                                                                                                         SENATOR McCAIN REITERATES SUPPORT FOR AMERICAN PRESENCE IN IRAQ March 27  2007 Washington  D C      U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today made the following statement on the Senate floor in support of removing language in the supplemental spending bill that would call for the withdrawal of troops from Iraq       Mr  President  I rise in support of an amendment that would strike the language in this bill calling for a withdrawal of American forces from Iraq       These same provisions were rejected by the Senate two weeks ago by a 48 50 vote  Now here we are  debating the same provisions that have the same serious problems  I hope they will be rejected again by the same  if not a larger margin  Supporters of this provision say they want a date certain for a U S  withdrawal from Iraq  But  Mr  President  what they have offered us is more accurately described as a date certain for surrender  with grave consequences for the future of Iraq  the stability of the Middle East and the security of Americans at home and abroad  And they offer it just as the situation in Iraq  though still fraught with difficult challenges  is beginning to improve       The new developments argue for more effort in Iraq  rather than the withdrawal advocated by this bill   s sponsors  As my colleagues know  I have been critical of the conduct of this war since 2003  and I very much regret that only now  four years into the conflict  are we beginning to implement the kind of strategy that was necessary from the start  a traditional counterinsurgency strategy that emphasizes protection of the population  economic development  and political progress  all with troop levels appropriate for the mission       We are seeing today the emergence of precisely such a strategy  I   d emphasize this point  this new plan is not    stay the course     We are not staying the course in Iraq and I would not support the status quo any more than I have over the past four years  Nor have we merely deployed a new commander  however capable  and additional forces  America is engaged today in a fundamentally new strategy  a new approach to the war  an approach that is already showing encouraging signs that it might succeed       Until now  U S  forces did not attempt to defeat the insurgency and the terrorists  protect the population  and end the violence so that political and economic progress could occur  Most American troops spent their days on large Forward Operating Bases  FOBs   making forays out into hostile territory in which they were subject to ambush  Today  U S  troops  along with Iraqi forces  are out of the FOBs and living in small outposts  Today  US forces are operating throughout Baghdad  even in Shi   ite strongholds such as Sadr city  Sunni areas like Mansoor  and mixed districts like Rashid  As of March 15  24 Joint Security Stations were operational with many more planned  American forces in these stations are visible every day  living among the population  building confidence that we     and not the terrorists     will prevail  Contrary to some predictions  this has not increased US casualties  And  not surprisingly  our presence has resulted in a dramatic increase in actionable intelligence about terrorists    You might not know it from reading newspapers or watching the evening news  but in Iraq today there are real signs that the new strategy is working  I   d like to spend just a few moments outlining some of this progress  not to paint an overly rosy scenario  but rather to correct what has become an almost single minded focus in the Congress on the prospects of defeat  The debate in Congress has an    Alice in Wonderland    quality about it  we are debating efforts to micro manage a conflict based on what the conditions were three months ago     NOT on what the reality is today  Conditions have changed in Iraq  The Baghdad Security Plan     the    surge        is working far better than even the most optimistic supporter had predicted  The progress is tangible in many key areas despite the fact that only 40 percent of the planned forces are in Iraq       Allow me to review some specifics  In Baghdad  the military has reported an increase in real time actionable intelligence  provided to U S  and Iraqi forces by a newly confident population  Prime Minister Maliki  who prevented U S  troops from conducting certain Baghdad operations last year  has given the green light to American incursions throughout the city  including Shiite strongholds  All of the Iraqi army battalions called for under the plan have arrived  many at or above 75 percent of their programmed manning levels  Bomb attacks and murders are down since the surge began  Civilians killed in Baghdad numbered 1222 in December  954 in January  and fell to 494 in February  There are reports of Sunni and Shia moving back into neighborhoods from which they had fled constant and horrific violence  Markets that have been subject to horrific car bombings have been turned into pedestrian malls that facilitate commerce and thwart terrorists       Moqtada al Sadr has fled  possibly to Iran  and has ordered his followers not to oppose the new Baghdad Security Plan  The Madhi Army  purportedly dedicated to the expulsion of Americans from Iraq  does not today openly challenge either U S  or Iraqi forces  American troops are engaged in reconstruction efforts in Sadr city  with the cooperation of the local mayor  And in western Baghdad  our troops are establishing new outposts in areas  red tabs  that have been conduits for al Qaeda in Iraq  AQI  penetration into the capital city  and have begun to clear these areas of terrorists and insurgents  The net result of all this is that key Shiite leaders are now claiming that the Baghdad Security Plan was their idea  and are taking credit for the increase in security     a development that would have unthinkable three months ago       There is progress outside Baghdad as well  Throughout Anbar Province  Sunni sheikhs have banded together to fight al Qaeda in Iraq  and are pouring recruits into the police forces  Sixteen of 26 tribes in that western province are now working against al Qaeda  With numerous senior al Qaeda leaders killed or captured  the younger  less experienced leaders are making mistakes  such as targeting respected sheikhs and murdering children  that have alienated Sunnis and their leaders       In Ramadi  hundreds of Iraqi police last week conducted a major sweep       In the surrounding areas  including Haditha  and Hit  U S  and Iraqi are conducting operations against al Qaeda and insurgents while protecting the population       In Diyala Province  U S  forces expelled al Qaeda forces from one of their major bases in January  seized major weapons caches  disrupted fighter networks  and cleared cities and villages of al Qaeda fighters  A U S  Stryker battalion has reinforced Diyala and is conducting major operations against AQI forces seeking to reconstitute  At the same time  other U S  forces in Diyala are acting against rogue Madhi Army leaders in the province and are holding the Diyala and Tigris Rivers to combat re infiltration into Baghdad       On the belt to the south of Baghdad  al Qaeda has come under heavy U S  pressure in recent weeks  with American forces destroying car bomb factories and uncovering major weapons caches in areas such as Yusufiya  Latifiya  and Salman Pak       In Mosul  U S  and Iraqi forces have killed and captured numerous al Qaeda operatives since December      In Samarra  American and Iraqi troops have captured al Qaeda facilitators and north of the city  Salahuddin Province  American troops have moved off of their Forward Operating Base and into the town of Bayji  an important hub on the road network      Mr  President  these developments  which have occurred just one month into the new strategy and with only a portion of the five additional U S  brigades having yet deployed  suggest that  at long last  we have a strategy in Iraq that is succeeding  That is not to say that all is going well in Iraq  clearly  it is not  Violence continues  the Madhi Army recently launched an attack in Basra  and one of Iraq   s Vice Presidents was gravely wounded in a bomb attack  But we all know the negatives  we read about them every day and see them flash across our television screens hourly  The enemy knows how attention getting car bombs are  and their strategy reflects this understanding      We must try to stop such events  and push the Iraqi government to move forward with its reconciliation efforts and meet the benchmarks laid out by the President  What we cannot do  and  for the sake of America   s vital national security interests  we must not do  is give up just at the moment we are starting to turn things around in Iraq       Yet in the face of this new reality  the proponents of the legislation offer one prescription for the future  withdrawal of U S  forces  Despite the progress  despite the ongoing need for U S  troops to stabilize Iraq and pave the way for a political solution  despite the moral burdens we have incurred as a result of our decision to topple Saddam Hussein  and  above all  despite the catastrophic consequences for vital U S  interests that would follow a premature withdrawal from Iraq  the sponsors of this legislation would force precisely that       To those who believe that the best course is to withdraw  I ask  Can you explain to the American people precisely what you believe to be the consequences of this action  If we follow the timetable included in this bill     to withdraw troops whether or not we are succeeding or failing  regardless of whether the country is secured  irrespective of whether the Iraqis can manage their own affairs alone  or whether the forces of terror and chaos will triumph     if we follow this timetable we risk a catastrophe for American national security interests       Note that American national security interests are directly at stake  Not just Israeli interests  though Prime Minister Olmert has said that defeat in Iraq could be devastating for his country  Not just for our Arab friends and partners in the region  though they fear the consequences of massive humanitarian displacement  growing Iranian influence  and wider bloodshed  Not just for the Iraqis themselves  for whom genocide is a real prospect should sectarian violence spiral out of control  But for America  Success or failure in Iraq is the transcendent issue for our foreign policy and our national security  People say they want to defeat the terrorists  But if we withdraw from Iraq prematurely  it will be the terrorists    greatest triumph      Withdrawing before there is a stable and legitimate Iraqi authority would turn Iraq into a failed state  in the heart of the Middle East  We have seen a failed state emerge after U S  disengagement once before  and it cost us terribly  In pre 9 11 Afghanistan  terrorists found sanctuary to train and plan attacks     including attacks against America     with impunity  If we leave Iraq based on an artificial timetable  al Qaeda will be free to plan  train for and conduct operations from Iraq just as they did from Afghanistan  We cannot make this fatal mistake twice      If Iraq descends into chaos  the power vacuum there will invite further Iranian interference  at a time when Tehran already feels emboldened  Iraq   s neighbors  from Saudi Arabia to Egypt to Turkey  would feel their own security eroding  and may intervene on the side of particular factions  This uncertain swirl of events could spark regional war severely damaging to America   s fundamental security interests  And we would then face a terrible choice  watch the region burn  watch the terrorists establish new bases  with profound implications for the safety of Americans and their economic well being  or send troops back into Iraq once again       Now  the proponents of withdrawal state that they envision no such catastrophe  they are not advocating a precipitous withdrawal but something more gradual  and they would leave American troops in place to focus on three limited objectives  protecting coalition personnel and infrastructure  training and equipping Iraqi forces  and conducting targeted counter terrorism operations  But if these three missions sound familiar  Mr  President  that   s because they formed the centerpiece of the strategy that was failing up until the beginning of this year  They would forbid counterinsurgency operations  protection of the population  and the other elements of our new strategy that are directly responsible for the successes we have seen this year  This legislation is a plan for failure  But neither failure nor success is the objective of its sponsors  They wish to get out of Iraq  whatever the consequences for America  They conceive no failure as worse than remaining in Iraq and no success worthy of additional sacrifice  They are wrong  Mr  President  terribly  terribly wrong      These provisions draw a false distinction between terrorism and sectarian violence  Let us think about the implications of ordering American soldiers to target    terrorists     but not those who foment sectarian violence  Was the attack on the Golden Mosque in Samarra a terrorist operation or the expression of sectarian violence  When the Madhi Army attacks government police stations  are they acting as terrorists or as a militia  When AQI attacks a Shia village along the Diyala River  is that terrorism or sectarian violence  What about when an American soldier comes across some unknown assailant burying an IED in the road  The obvious answer is that such acts very often constitute terrorism in Iraq and sectarian violence in Iraq  The two are deeply intertwined  To try and make an artificial distinction between terrorism and sectarian violence is to fundamentally misunderstand al Qaeda   s strategy   which is to incite sectarian violence  To say that targeting terrorist violence is allowable while stopping sectarian violence is illegal flies in the face of this reality  and would make it impossible to fight this war against terrorism  let alone prevail in it       Mr  President  some senators have taken a different tack  arguing that Iraq is still winnable but that  by withdrawing troops  we will actually maximize the chances of success  They concede that a withdrawal will encourage insurgents and terrorists to unleash greater violence on the Iraqi people  but believe that such violence might induce Iraqi politicians to make the political decisions necessary to end it  Could this possibly be true  Can we  by withdrawing our troops from Iraq  actually increase the stability in Iraq rather than risk catastrophe  and induce a political solution rather than make it less possible  Is success in Iraq as simple as issuing redeployment orders  a move blocked only by stubborn commanders and civilian authorities      General David Petraeus  for one  believes that it is not  Of course the dire situation in Iraq demands a political solution  That is undeniably true  But a political solution among the Iraqis cannot be simply conjured  It is impossible for meaningful political and economic activity to take place in an environment as riddled with violence as Baghdad has been  Security is the precondition for political and economic progress  and without security  we will not see the political progress all of us agree is necessary  In this regard  there are positive indications  Prime Minister Maliki went to Ramadi to reach out to Sunnis  and the Iraqi government is pushing through a new de Baathification law  The oil revenue sharing law has been approved by the Council of Ministers and should be approved by parliament soon  Reports indicate that Iraqi officials are in discussions with a number of non AQI Sunni insurgent groups  while fighting has broken out between AQI and Sunni insurgents       Reconciliation is not the inevitable outcome of the new strategy  On the contrary  there is no guarantee of success  What the situation demands is not a guarantee  but rather a strategy designed to give us the best possible chance for success  This  I believe  is what the new plan represents       The provisions our amendment would strike would force redeployments of U S  forces within 120 days  and nearly all troops would have to leave Iraq by March 31  2008  This does not incentivize the Government of Iraq to make tough decisions on reconciliation  it sets the stage for the government   s collapse  This arbitrary deadline informs our enemies when they need no longer fear American military power  It signals to the population that their best bet for security really does rest in the hands of militias  rather than the government  It demonstrates to the government that they cannot rely on us     after all  we are pulling out regardless of the situation or the consequences  And it tells the terrorists that they     not we     will prevail       All of us want to bring our troops home  and to do so as soon as possible  None of us  no matter how we voted on the resolution authorizing this war  believes the situation that existed until recently is sustainable  But there is a new situation  a new reality in Iraq  This amendment ignores that reality and ignores the consequences that would flow from its adoption  When Congress authorized this war  we committed America to a mission that entails the greatest sacrifice a country can make  one that falls disproportionately on those Americans who love their country so much that they volunteer to risk their lives to accomplish that mission  And when we authorized this war  we accepted the responsibility to make sure they could prevail  When we voted to send them into battle we asked them to use every ounce of their courage and fortitude on behalf of us       This body unanimously confirmed General Petraeus  Why would we now deprive him of the opportunity to pursue the strategy he helped design and believes can work  Why would we hand our enemies a victory when we have finally taken the initiative and they are on the defensive  Let us give him and the soldiers he has the honor to command  Americans who are risking everything so that this new plan can succeed  the time necessary to achieve its objectives       And let us  elected officials who have the honor of overseeing the conduct of our soldiers    mission in Iraq  exercise a lesser magnitude of courage     our political courage on behalf of them and the country they serve  If any Senator believes that our troops    sacrifice is truly in vain  the dictates of conscience demand that he or she act to prevent it  Those who would cut off all funding for this war  though I disagree deeply with their position  and dread its consequences  have the courage of their convictions  and I respect them for it      If  on the other hand  you believe  as I do  that an increase of U S  troops in Iraq  carrying out a counterinsurgency mission  provides the best chance for success in Iraq  then you should give your support to this new strategy  It may not be popular nor politically expedient  but we are always at our best when we put aside the small politics of the day in the interest of our nation and the values upon which they rest       Those are the only responsible  the only honorable choices before us  There are no others  Mr  President  I wish there were  But here we are  confronting a political  military and moral dilemma of immense importance  with the country   s most vital security interests and the lives of the best Americans among us at stake  May God grant us the wisdom and humility to make this difficult judgment in our country   s best interests only  and the courage to accept our responsibility for the consequences that will ensue       I yield the floor                                               March 2007 Press Releases
