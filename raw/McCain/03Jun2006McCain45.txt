                                                                                                                         STATEMENT ON MARRIAGE PROTECTION AMENDMENT June 6  2006 Washington  DC   Today  U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  spoke on the floor of the United States Senate about the Marriage Protection Amendment   The following is the text of his statement as prepared and submitted for the record   Mr  President  I believe that the institution of marriage can serve its public purposes only when it is understood as being a union between one man and one woman  It is this understanding that offers public reinforcement to the vital and unique roles played by mothers and fathers in the raising of their children  It is this understanding that offers a foundation for principled objections to those who would pursue the imprudent agenda of dismantling an institution that has served us well  and replacing it with newer and more flexible understandings that are of questionable public value   I also believe in the institution of republican government as described in the United States Constitution  This  too  is an institution that has served us well  founded upon the precept that the American people speak through their elected representatives  and these representatives remain at all times answerable and accountable to the people whom they serve  Today  on the question of marriage  we are told by advocates on both sides of the debate that these two institutions  as they are currently understood  cannot be reconciled  and that one or the other must be changed  I do not agree  and thus I do not at this time support the proposed Marriage Protection Amendment   The proposed amendment would establish in our Constitution a permanent resolution of a debate that is currently and properly being resolved in different ways  in fifty different states  by the people s elected representatives  Our system of federalism is not easily separable from our commitment to republican government  because it is driven by the idea that we are best governed when those who represent us live where we live  and share the values that we share  It is this understanding that has allowed us the strength  as a nation  to time and again preserve our unity and confront our challenges in times of crisis  no matter how great our differences on issues that are the subject of heated public debate  The continued vitality of America s commitment to federalism and republican government offers a hopeful example to strife torn areas of our world where conflicts are tragically settled with bullets rather than ballots  The Constitutional value of federalism is doubly important in the area of family law  because power to legislate in this area has traditionally been reserved to the states  and because issues of family structure affect the fabric of the broader community  creating the opportunity for approaches that reflect the values of the states that form our nation   Most Americans believe  as do I  that the institution of marriage should be reserved for the union of a man and a woman  Wherever the question of same sex marriage has been put to the test of public approval  it has been decisively rejected  Presently  nineteen states protect in their constitutions traditional definitions of marriage  In 2004  amendments to state constitutions preserving the institution of marriage exclusively as the union of a man and woman were placed on the ballot in thirteen states  All thirteen passed by substantial margins  Thus far  seven states have a constitutional amendment on the ballot this year  There is little doubt they will all prevail  Proponents of an amendment to my state s constitution  which I support  are working hard to collect the required number of signatures to secure a place on the November ballot  If we succeed  I am certain Arizonans will adopt it overwhelmingly   There can be little doubt that a sizeable majority of the American people  whatever their views on other questions involving the rights of homosexuals in our society  strongly support reserving the institution of marriage for the union of one man and one woman  That majority includes  I am confident  majorities in every state in the union  It includes Americans of both political parties  whose voting habits and general political philosophy range from conservative to moderate to liberal   It is obvious that there is a broad consensus in this country in support of the traditional definition of marriage  And  Mr  President  when the American people are so decided in a public debate their elected representatives will defend that consensus  Forty five states have either constitutional protections or statutes on the books defining marriage in traditional terms  In 1996  Congress passed and President Clinton signed into law the Defense of Marriage Act  which allows each state to deny within its boundaries the status of marriage to the union of a same sex couple that may have been recognized in another state  To date  the Defense of Marriage Act has not been successfully challenged in federal court   The broad consensus in support of traditional marriage does not yet extend to support for the measure we are debating today  an amendment to the federal constitution defining marriage as the union between a man and a woman  I suspect that is because most Americans are not yet convinced that their elected representatives or the judiciary are likely to expand decisively the definition of marriage to include same sex couples   Obviously  the Massachusetts Supreme Court s ruling in 2003 effectively extended lawful marriage to same sex couples even though it is apparent that a majority of Massachusetts residents do not support that change in the interpretation of the state s marriage laws  But there are political remedies to what  I believe  can be fairly criticized as judicial activism that ignored the will of the people and denied a state government its long established right to regulate marriage  In Massachusetts  more than 120 000 voters signed a petition to place on the ballot an amendment to the Commonwealth s constitution restoring the traditional definition of marriage  A constitutional convention to consider amending the Massachusetts constitution is scheduled to convene on July 12th   The Nebraska decision is under review by the U S  Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit  which has already heard oral arguments in the case  and might issue a ruling as early as this summer  Most analysts  on both sides of the debate  believe the lower court s decision will be reversed  and the exclusive protections for traditional marriage that the people of Nebraska adopted in 2000 by a vote of 70  will be restored to their constitution  Nebraska s Attorney General has not even felt it necessary to ask for a stay of the district court s decision pending the outcome of the appeal  which would almost certainly have been granted  I assume this is because Nebraska still has a defense of marriage law on the books  and there are no same sex marriage cases pending in Nebraska courts or same sex marriage legislation pending in the Nebraska legislature   I understand that the precipitous Massachusetts decision  as well as the unlawful granting of marriage licenses to same sex couples in a few localities outside Massachusetts  challenges to traditional marriage laws in other states  and the decision last year by the federal district court in Nebraska that struck down an amendment to Nebraska s constitution restricting marriage to a man and a woman have added to the support for a federal marriage amendment  While that support does not mirror the broad national consensus in support of traditional marriage  it is substantial and passionate  I understand that and I respect it  and I agree that marriage as a uniquely important institution should be protected  But I do not agree that all the above circumstances have made it necessary to usurp from the states  by means of an amendment to the federal Constitution  their traditional role in regulating marriage  I m reluctant to abandon the federalism that is part of the essence of conservative political thought in our country  And I am very wary of the unintended consequences that might follow from making an exception to our federalist principles for the sake of addressing a threat to the institution of marriage that may still  indeed  seems likely to be  defeated by means far less precedent setting than amending our nation s Constitution   Of course  while I disagree that the current Constitutional structure provides insufficient mechanisms for ensuring that the public meaning of marriage is not tampered with by activist judges  it would be disingenuous to argue that those who support the proposed Amendment have no grounds for their concern  In recent decades there have been too many occasions on which the federal courts  including the Supreme Court  have forgotten their proper role  and abandoned the virtues of federalism and republican government in favor of imposing their own policy preferences in the guise of Constitutional interpretation  Decisions such as Roe v  Wade continue to distort the democratic process in ways large and small to this very day  It is a telling commentary on those who seek to change the longstanding public meaning of marriage that in many instances they have chosen to pursue their agenda through the courts rather than taking their case to the people  Those who wish to engage the issue in good faith should reject out of hand attempts to read into the Constitution a right to same sex marriage  because the Constitution says absolutely nothing about it  and because the longstanding traditions of American society have defined legal marriage as a union between one man and one woman  Indeed  yet another reason I am reluctant to support the proposed Amendment at this point in time is that I do not accept the proposition that the current Constitution could ever reasonably be read to contain a supposed  right  that it plainly does not contain   It is just not clear to me  Mr  President  that threats to the institution of marriage that have arisen in recent times have become a permanent breach of state authorities  traditional role in regulating and defining marriage as the people of their states and their elected representatives see fit  My confidence that the public meaning of marriage will be decided in the context of federalism and republican government rather than by judicial fiat is strengthened by the recent confirmations of Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito  and I hope that future appointments to the state and federal courts give us judges who share a similar understanding of the courts  proper role in our Constitutional system   However  if I am wrong  and the Nebraska decision were to be upheld on appeal  or were other challenges to state marriage laws made and upheld  or if majority sentiment and legislative remedies in affected states fail to overcome peremptory judicial intrusions into the political process of defining marriage  or if the Supreme Court were to reject the Defense of Marriage Act  then  and only then  would the problem justify Congress making the momentous decision to amend the most enduring and successful political compact in human history as the only recourse means to restore the public s right to define  according to the values and concerns of our communities  a critically important foundation of our society   Let me pose a hypothetical situation  Mr  President  to illustrate why we should be reluctant to impose a Constitutional remedy to a problem that will probably be resolved in an ordinary  state by state political process  consistent with the respect for federalism we Republicans have long claimed as one of our virtues  Those of us who consider ourselves pro life would welcome the Supreme Court s reversal of the Roe v  Wade decision that found a Constitutional right to an abortion  The result of that reversal would be to return the regulation of abortion to the states  where the values of local communities would be influential  Now  further suppose that abortion rights advocates held majorities in both houses of Congress  and rather than argue state by state for liberal abortion laws  they decided to usurp the states  authority by means of a constitutional amendment protecting abortion  Wouldn t we who consider ourselves federalists loudly protest such a move  Wouldn t we all line up on the floor to quote Mr  Madison from Federalist Paper 45  that the powers reserved to the several states will extend to all the objects  which  in the ordinary course of affairs  concern the lives  liberties and properties of the people  and the internal order  improvement and prosperity of the State  Yes  we would  Mr  President  yes  we would   Mr  President  I believe that in the ordinary course of affairs  the American people s clear preference to retain intact the institution of marriage  defined according to the values of our communities as the union of one man and one woman  will prevail  and that attempts to ignore the people s will  either by judicial fiat or by the occasional enterprising politician will  in due course  be overcome  I might be wrong  Mr  President  and I respect the concerns of Americans who believe current circumstances urgently require the Constitutional protection of traditionally defined marriage  But I do not believe that recent developments yet pose a threat to marriage that cannot be overcome by means short of a Constitutional amendment   While I will vote in opposition to this amendment  I believe its advocates should be reassured that if in the future the public meaning of marriage is taken from the hands of the people and altered by judges who claim falsely to speak before all others for the people s constitutional ideals  then it will be the people  acting through their elected representatives in this chamber  who will at that time have the final word  Until then  however  I will trust in the American people and the elected representatives closest to them to pass and enforce laws upholding the institution of marriage in accord with the values of their communities                                                      June 2006 Press Releases           Browse by
