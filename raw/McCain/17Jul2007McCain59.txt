                                                                                                                         SENATOR McCAIN CLOSING REMARKS ON LEVIN REED IRAQ WAR AMENDMENT July 18  2007 WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  today made the following closing statement on the Senate floor about the Levin Reed amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act of FY 2008       Mr  President  we have nearly finished this little exhibition  which was staged  I assume  for the benefit of a briefly amused press corps and in deference to political activists opposed to the war who have come to expect from Congress such gestures  empty though they may be  as proof that the majority in the Senate has heard their demands for action to end the war in Iraq  The outcome of this debate  the vote we are about to take  has never been in doubt to a single member of this body  And to state the obvious  nothing we have done for the last twenty four hours will have changed any facts on the ground in Iraq or made the outcome of the war any more or less important to the security of our country  The stakes in this war remain as high today as they were yesterday  the consequences of an American defeat are just as grave  the costs of success just as dear  No battle will have been won or lost  no enemy will have been captured or killed  no ground will have been taken or surrendered  no soldier will have survived or been wounded  died or come home because we spent an entire night delivering our poll tested message points  spinning our soundbites  arguing with each other  and substituting our amateur theatrics for statesmanship  All we have achieved are remarkably similar newspaper accounts of our inflated sense of the drama of this display and our own temporary physical fatigue  Tomorrow the press will move on to other things and we will be better rested  But nothing else will have changed      In Iraq  American soldiers  Marines  sailors and airmen are still fighting bravely and tenaciously in battles that are as dangerous  difficult and consequential as the great battles of our armed forces    storied past  Our enemies will still be intent on defeating us  and using our defeat to encourage their followers in the jihad they wage against us  a war which will become a greater threat to us should we quit the central battlefield in defeat  The Middle East will still be a tinderbox  which our defeat could ignite in a regional war that will imperil our vital interests at risk there and draw us into a longer and far more costly war  The prospect of genocide in Iraq  in which we will be morally complicit  is still as real a consequence of our withdrawal today as it was yesterday      During our extended debate over the last few days  I have heard senators repeat certain arguments over and over again  My friends on the other side of this argument accuse those of us who oppose this amendment with advocating    staying the course     which is intended to suggest that we are intent on continuing the mistakes that have put the outcome of the war in doubt  Yet we all know that with the arrival of General Petraeus we have changed course  We are now fighting a counterinsurgency strategy  which some of us have argued we should have been following from the beginning  and which makes the most effective use of our strength and does not strengthen the tactics of our enemy  This new battle plan is succeeding where our previous tactics have failed  although the outcome remains far from certain  The tactics proposed in the amendment offered by my friends  Senators Levin and Reed     a smaller force  confined to bases distant from the battlefield  from where they will launch occasional search and destroy missions and train the Iraqi military     are precisely the tactics employed for most of this war and which have  by anyone   s account  failed miserably  Now  that  Mr  President  is staying the course  and it is a course that inevitably leads to our defeat and the catastrophic consequences for Iraq  the region and the security of the United States our defeat would entail      Yes  we have heard quite a lot about the folly of    staying the course     though the real outcome should this amendment prevail and be signed into law  would be to deny our generals and the Americans they have the honor to command the ability to try  in this late hour  to address the calamity these tried and failed tactics produced  and salvage from the wreckage of our previous failures a measure of stability for Iraq and the Middle East  and a more secure future for the American people       I have also listened to my colleagues on the other side repeatedly remind us that the American people have spoken in the last election  They have demanded we withdraw from Iraq  and it is our responsibility to do  as quickly as possible  what they have bid us to do  But is that our primary responsibility  Really  Mr  President  is that how we construe our role  to follow without question popular opinion even if we believe it to be in error  and likely to endanger the security of the country we have sworn to defend  Surely  we must be responsive to the people who have elected us to office  and who  if it is their wish  will remove us when they become unsatisfied with our failure to heed their demands  I understand that  of course  And I understand why so many Americans have become sick and tired of this war  given the many  many mistakes made by civilian and military leaders in its prosecution  I  too  have been made sick at heart by these mistakes and the terrible price we have paid for them  But I cannot react to these mistakes by embracing a course of action that I know will be an even greater mistake  a mistake of colossal historical proportions  which will    and I am as sure of this as I am of anything     seriously endanger the people I represent and the country I have served all my adult life  I have many responsibilities to the people of Arizona  and to all Americans  I take them all seriously  Mr  President  or try to  But I have one responsibility that outweighs all the others     and that is to do everything in my power  to use whatever meager talents I posses  and every resource God has granted me to protect the security of this great and good nation from all enemies foreign and domestic  And that I intend to do  Mr  President  even if I must stand athwart popular opinion  I will explain my reasons to the American people  I will attempt to convince as many of my countrymen as I can that we must show even greater patience  though our patience is nearly exhausted  and that as long as there is a prospect for not losing this war  then we must not choose to lose it  That is how I construe my responsibility to my constituency and my country  That is how I construed it yesterday  It is how I construe it today  And it is how I will construe it tomorrow  I do not know how I could choose any other course       I cannot be certain that I possess the skills to be persuasive  I cannot be certain that even if I could convince Americans to give General Petraeus the time he needs to determine whether we can prevail  that we will prevail in Iraq  All I am certain of is that our defeat there would be catastrophic  not just for Iraq  but for us  and that I cannot be complicit in it  but must do whatever I can  whether I am effective or not  to help us try to avert it  That  Mr  President  is all I can possibly offer my country at this time  It is not much compared to the sacrifices made by Americans who have volunteered to shoulder a rifle and fight this war for us  I know that  and am humbled by it  as we all are  But though my duty is neither dangerous nor onerous  it compels me nonetheless to say to my colleagues and to all Americans who disagree with me  that as long as we have a chance to succeed we must try to succeed       I am privileged  as we all are  to be subject to the judgment of the American people and history  But  my friends  they are not always the same judgment  The verdict of the people will arrive long before history   s  I am unlikely to ever know how history has judged us in this hour  The public   s judgment of me I will know soon enough  I will accept it  as I must  But whether it is favorable or unforgiving  I will stand where I stand  and take comfort from my confidence that I took my responsibilities to my country seriously  and despite the mistakes I have made as a public servant and the flaws I have as an advocate  I tried as best I could to help the country we all love remain as safe as she could be in an hour of serious peril                                               July
