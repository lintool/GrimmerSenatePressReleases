                                                                                                                         TESTIMONY OF SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN   LOBBYING REFORM PROPOSALS January 25  2006 U S  Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs  January 25  2006  Madam Chairman  let me begin by thanking you and Senator Lieberman for holding this important hearing today  There is no doubt that a crisis of confidence exists in how Congress is perceived by the American people  Poll after poll reveals that a majority of the American people see those us who serve in Congress as the lowest of the low  We need to fix that  We need to restore the confidence of the American people by proving to them that we can make tough decisions and end corrupting practices  We need to restore the confidence of the American people in their government  not so that we can all stay in office  but so that our children and our grandchildren will have a trustworthy  reliable government upon which they can depend   As you all know  over the past year and a half  the Indian Affairs Committee has unearthed a story of excess and abuse by former lobbyists of a few Indian tribes  The story is alarming in its depth and breadth of potential wrongdoing  It has spanned across the United States  sweeping up tribes throughout Indian Country  It has taken us from Tribal reservations across America to luxury sports boxes here in town  from a sham international think tank in Rehoboth Beach  Delaware to a sniper workshop in Israel  and beyond  It involves tens of millions of dollars that we know about  and likely more that we do not  Much of what the Committee learned was extraordinary  Yet  much of what we uncovered in the investigation was unfortunately the ordinary way of doing business in this town   How these lobbyists sought to influence policy and opinion makers is a case study in the ways lobbyists seek to curry favor with legislators and their aides  For example  they sought to ingratiate themselves with public servants with tickets to plush skyboxes at the MCI Center  FedEx Field  and Camden Yards for sports and entertainment events  They arranged extravagant getaways to tropical islands  the famed golfing links of St  Andrews  and elsewhere  They regularly treated people to meals and drinks  Fundraisers and contributions abounded   During its investigation  the Committee also learned about unscrupulous tactics employed to lobby Members and to shape public opinion  We found a sham international think tank in Rehoboth Beach  Delaware  established  in part  to disguise the true identity of clients  We saw phony Christian grassroots organizations consisting of a box of cell phones in a desk drawer  I would submit that in the great marketplace of ideas we call public discourse  truth is a premium that we cannot sacrifice  Through these practices  the lobbyists distorted the truth  not only with false messages  but also with fake messengers   Many cast blame only on the lobbying industry  But  we should not forget that we  as Members  owe it to the American people to conduct ourselves in a way that reinforces  rather than diminishes  the public s faith and confidence in Congress   Because of the pressing need to address the cynicism of the American public  I introduced a bill to provide greater transparency into the process of influencing our government  and to ensure greater accountability among public officials  The legislation does a number of things  It provides for faster reporting and greater public access to reports filed by lobbyists and their employers under the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995  It requires greater disclosure of the activities of lobbyists  including for the first time  grassroots lobbying firms  The bill also requires greater disclosure from both lobbyists  and Members and employees of Congress  about travel that is arranged or financed by a lobbyist or his client   To understand more thoroughly the actions lobbyists take to influence elected officials  the bill requires lobbying firms  lobbyists  and their political action committees to disclose their campaign contributions to federal candidates and officeholders  their political action committees  and political party committees  It further mandates disclosure of fundraisers hosted  co hosted  or otherwise sponsored by these entities  and disclosure of contributions for other events involving legislative and executive branch officials   To get behind anonymous coalitions and associations and discover who actually is seeking to influence government  the bill requires registrants to list as clients those entities that contribute  10 000 or more to a coalition or association  The bill expressly keeps intact  however  existing law governing the disclosure of the identities of members and donors to organizations designated as 501 c  groups under the Internal Revenue Code   I have read news reports that the Department of Justice is investigating job negotiations that some public officials may have had with lobbying firms while still in government  negotiations that may have compromised their job performance  I have long been concerned with the revolving door between public service and the private sector  how that door is spun for personal gain  and the corrupting influences that can creep through that door into government decision making  To address the problem  I am proposing to expand the cooling off period to two years for Members of Congress and senior staff  and certain Executive Branch officials  And  to ensure a level playing field  I am seeking to close a loophole that has existed in Federal conflict of interest laws for those who represent Indian tribes   To ensure compliance with Congressional restrictions on accepting gifts  the bill requires registrants under the Lobbying Disclosure Act to report gifts worth  20 or more  To more accurately reflect the true value of benefits received  the bill also requires Members of Congress and staff to pay the fair market value for travel on private planes  and values sports and entertainment tickets in skyboxes at the cost of the highest priced ticket in the arena   Madam Chairman and Sen  Lieberman  an informed citizenry is essential to a thriving democracy  And  a democratic government operates best in the disinfecting light of the public eye  The Senate s approach should be one of greater disclosure of and transparency into the interactions of lobbyists with our public officials  My legislation is intended to balance the right of the public to know with its right to petition government  the ability of lobbyists to advocate their clients  causes with the need for truthful public discourse  and  the ability of Members to legislate with the imperative that our government must be free from corrupting influences  both real and perceived  We must act now to ensure that the erosion we see today in the public s confidence in Congress does not become a collapse of confidence   Again  thank you for holding this important hearing  and thank you for giving me the opportunity to present my views
