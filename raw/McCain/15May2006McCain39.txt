                                                                                                                         MCCAIN SPEAKS AT NEW SCHOOL May 19  2006 New York  New York   Today  U S  Senator John McCain  R AZ  delivered the commencement address at The New School in New York City  The following is the text of his address   Thank you  Bob  Thank you  faculty  families and friends  and thank you New School Class of 2006 for your welcome and for your kind invitation to give this year s commencement address  I want to join in the chorus of congratulations to the Class of 2006  This is a day to bask in praise  You ve earned it  You have succeeded in a demanding course of instruction  Life seems full of promise as is always the case when a passage in life is marked by significant accomplishment  Today  it might seem as if the world attends you   But spare a moment for those who have truly attended you so well for so long  and whose pride in your accomplishments is even greater than your own  your parents  When the world was looking elsewhere your parents  attention was one of life s certainties  So  as I commend you  I offer equal praise to your parents for the sacrifices they made for you  for their confidence in you and their love  More than any other influence in your lives they have helped make you the success you are today and might become tomorrow   Thousands of commencement addresses are given every year  many by people with greater eloquence and more original minds than I possess  And it s difficult on such occasions to avoid resorting to cliches  So let me just say that I wish you all well  This is a wonderful time to be young  and to have your opportunities  Make the most of them   When I was in your situation  many  many years ago  an undistinguished graduate  barely  of the Naval Academy  I listened to President Eisenhower deliver the commencement address  I admired President Eisenhower greatly  But I remember little of his remarks that day  impatient as I was to enjoy the less formal celebrations of graduation  and mindful that given my class standing I would not have the privilege of shaking the President s hand  I do recall  vaguely  that he encouraged his audience of new navy ensigns and Marine lieutenants to become crusaders for peace   I became an aviator and  eventually  an instrument of war in Vietnam  I believed  as did many of my friends  we were defending the cause of a just peace  Some Americans believed we were agents of American imperialism who were not overly troubled by the many tragedies of war and the difficult moral dilemmas that constantly confront soldiers  Ours is a noisy  contentious society  and always has been  for we love our liberties much  And among those liberties we love most  particularly so when we are young  is our right to self expression  That passion for self expression sometimes overwhelms our civility  and our presumption that those with whom we have strong disagreements  wrong as they might be  believe that they  too  are answering the demands of their conscience   When I was a young man  I was quite infatuated with self expression  and rightly so because  if memory conveniently serves  I was so much more eloquent  well informed  and wiser than anyone else I knew  It seemed I understood the world and the purpose of life so much more profoundly than most people  I believed that to be especially true with many of my elders  people whose only accomplishment  as far as I could tell  was that they had been born before me  and  consequently  had suffered some number of years deprived of my insights  I had opinions on everything  and I was always right  I loved to argue  and I could become understandably belligerent with people who lacked the grace and intelligence to agree with me  With my superior qualities so obvious  it was an intolerable hardship to have to suffer fools gladly  So I rarely did  All their resistance to my brilliantly conceived and cogently argued views proved was that they possessed an inferior intellect and a weaker character than God had blessed me with  and I felt it was my clear duty to so inform them  It s a pity that there wasn t a blogosphere then  I would have felt very much at home in the medium   It s funny  now  how less self assured I feel late in life than I did when I lived in perpetual springtime  Some of my critics allege that age hasn t entirely cost me the conceits of my youth  All I can say to them is  they should have known me then  when I was brave and true and better looking than I am at present  But as the great poet  Yeats  wrote  All that s beautiful drifts away  like the waters  I have lost some of the attributes that were the object of a young man s vanity  But there have been compensations  which I have come to hold dear   We have our disagreements  we Americans  We contend regularly and enthusiastically over many questions  over the size and purposes of our government  over the social responsibilities we accept in accord with the dictates of our conscience and our faithfulness to the God we pray to  over our role in the world and how to defend our security interests and values in places where they are threatened  These are important questions  worth arguing about  We should contend over them with one another  It is more than appropriate  it is necessary that even in times of crisis  especially in times of crisis  we fight among ourselves for the things we believe in  It is not just our right  but our civic and moral obligation   Our country doesn t depend on the heroism of every citizen  But all of us should be worthy of the sacrifices made on our behalf  We have to love our freedom  not just for the private opportunities it provides  but for the goodness it makes possible  We have to love it as much  even if not as heroically  as the brave Americans who defend us at the risk and often the cost of their lives  We must love it enough to argue about it  and to serve it  in whatever way our abilities permit and our conscience requires  whether it calls us to arms or to altruism or to politics   I supported the decision to go to war in Iraq  Many Americans did not  My patriotism and my conscience required me to support it and to engage in the debate over whether and how to fight it  I stand that ground not to chase vainglorious dreams of empire  not for a noxious sense of racial superiority over a subject people  not for cheap oil    we could have purchased oil from the former dictator at a price far less expensive than the blood and treasure we ve paid to secure those resources for the people of that nation  not for the allure of chauvinism  to wreak destruction in the world in order to feel superior to it  not for a foolishly romantic conception of war  I stand that ground because I believed  rightly or wrongly  that my country s interests and values required it   War is an awful business  The lives of the nation s finest patriots are sacrificed  Innocent people suffer  Commerce is disrupted  economies damaged  Strategic interests shielded by years of statecraft are endangered as the demands of war and diplomacy conflict  Whether the cause was necessary or not  whether it was just or not  we should all shed a tear for all that is lost when war claims its wages from us  However just or false the cause  how ever proud and noble the service  it is loss  the loss of friends  the loss of innocent life  the loss of innocence   that the veteran feels most keenly forever more  Only a fool or a fraud sentimentalizes war   Americans should argue about this war  It has cost the lives of nearly 2500 of the best of us  It has taken innocent life  It has imposed an enormous financial burden on our economy  At a minimum  it has complicated our ability to respond to other looming threats  Should we lose this war  our defeat will further destabilize an already volatile and dangerous region  strengthen the threat of terrorism  and unleash furies that will assail us for a very long time  I believe the benefits of success will justify the costs and risks we have incurred  But if an American feels the decision was unwise  then they should state their opposition  and argue for another course  It is your right and your obligation  I respect you for it  I would not respect you if you chose to ignore such an important responsibility  But I ask that you consider the possibility that I  too  am trying to meet my responsibilities  to follow my conscience  to do my duty as best as I can  as God has given me light to see that duty   Americans deserve more than tolerance from one another  we deserve each other s respect  whether we think each other right or wrong in our views  as long as our character and our sincerity merit respect  and as long as we share  for all our differences  for all the noisy debates that enliven our politics  a mutual devotion to the sublime idea that this nation was conceived in  that freedom is the inalienable right of mankind  and in accord with the laws of nature and nature s Creator   We have so much more that unites us than divides us  We need only to look to the enemy who now confronts us  and the benighted ideals to which Islamic extremists pledge allegiance   their disdain for the rights of Man  their contempt for innocent human life   to appreciate how much unites us   Take  for example  the awful human catastrophe under way in the Darfur region of the Sudan  If the United States and the West can be criticized for our role in this catastrophe it is because we have waited too long to intervene to protect the multitudes who are suffering  dying because of it   Twelve years ago  we turned a blind eye to another genocide  in Rwanda  And when that reign of terror finally  mercifully exhausted itself  with over 800 000 Rwandans slaughtered  Americans  our government  and decent people everywhere in the world were shocked and ashamed of our silence and inaction  for ignoring our values  and the demands of our conscience  In shame and renewed allegiance to our ideals  we swore  not for the first time  never again  But never lasted only until the tragedy of Darfur   Now  belatedly  we have recovered our moral sense of duty  and are prepared  I hope  to put an end to this genocide  Osama bin Laden and his followers  ready  as always  to sacrifice anything and anyone to their hatred of the West and our ideals  have called on Muslims to rise up against any Westerner who dares intervene to stop the genocide  even though Muslims  hundreds of thousands of Muslims  are its victims  Now that  my friends  is a difference  a cause  worth taking up arms against   It is not a clash of civilizations  I believe  as I hope all Americans would believe  that no matter where people live  no matter their history or religious beliefs or the size of their GDP  all people share the desire to be free  to make by their own choices and industry better lives for themselves and their children  Human rights exist above the state and beyond history  they are God given  They cannot be rescinded by one government any more than they can be granted by another  They inhabit the human heart  and from there  though they may be abridged  they can never be wrenched   This is a clash of ideals  a profound and terrible clash of ideals  It is a fight between right and wrong  Relativism has no place in this confrontation  We re not defending an idea that every human being should eat corn flakes  play baseball or watch MTV  We re not insisting that all societies be governed by a bicameral legislature and a term limited chief executive  We are insisting that all people have a right to be free  and that right is not subject to the whims and interests and authority of another person  government or culture  Relativism  in this contest  is most certainly not a sign of our humility or ecumenism  it is a mask for arrogance and selfishness  It is  and I mean this sincerely and with all humility  not worthy of us  We are a better people than that   We are not a perfect nation  Our history has had its moments of shame and profound regret  But what we have achieved in our brief history is irrefutable proof that a nation conceived in liberty will prove stronger  more decent and more enduring than any nation ordered to exalt the few at the expense of the many or made from a common race or culture or to preserve traditions that have no greater attribute than longevity   As blessed as we are  no nation complacent in its greatness can long sustain it  We  too  must prove  as those who came before us proved  that a people free to act in their own interests  will perceive those interests in an enlightened way  will live as one nation  in a kinship of ideals  and make of our power and wealth a civilization for the ages  a civilization in which all people share in the promise and responsibilities of freedom   Should we claim our rights and leave to others the duty to the ideals that protect them  whatever we gain for ourselves will be of little lasting value  It will build no monuments to virtue  claim no honored place in the memory of posterity  offer no worthy summons to the world  Success  wealth and celebrity gained and kept for private interest is a small thing  It makes us comfortable  eases the material hardships our children will bear  purchases a fleeting regard for our lives  yet not the self respect that  in the end  matters most  But sacrifice for a cause greater than yourself  and you invest your life with the eminence of that cause  your self respect assured   All lives are a struggle against selfishness  All my life I ve stood a little apart from institutions I willingly joined  It just felt natural to me  But if my life had shared no common purpose  it would not have amounted to much more than eccentricity  There is no honor or happiness in just being strong enough to be left alone  I have spent nearly fifty years in the service of this country and its ideals  I have made many mistakes  and I have many regrets  But I have never lived a day  in good times or bad  that I wasn t grateful for the privilege  That s the benefit of service to a country that is an idea and a cause  a righteous idea and cause  America and her ideals helped spare me from the weaknesses in my own character  And I cannot forget it   When I was a young man  I thought glory was the highest attainment  and all glory was self glory  My parents tried to teach me otherwise  as did my church  as did the Naval Academy  But I didn t understand the lesson until later in life  when I confronted challenges I never expected to face   In that confrontation  I discovered that I was dependent on others to a greater extent than I had ever realized  but neither they nor the cause we served made any claims on my identity  On the contrary  they gave me a larger sense of myself than I had before  And I am a better man for it  I discovered that nothing in life is more liberating than to fight for a cause that encompasses you but is not defined by your existence alone  And that has made all the difference  my friends  all the difference in the world   Let us argue with each other then  By all means  let us argue  Our differences are not petty  they often involve cherished beliefs  and represent our best judgment about what is right for our country and humanity  Let us defend those beliefs  Let s do so sincerely and strenuously  It is our right and duty to do so  And let s not be too dismayed with the tenor and passion of our arguments  even when they wound us  We have fought among ourselves before in our history  over big things and small  with worse vitriol and bitterness than we experience today   Let us exercise our responsibilities as free people  But let us remember  we are not enemies  We are compatriots defending ourselves from a real enemy  We have nothing to fear from each other  We are arguing over the means to better secure our freedom  promote the general welfare and defend our ideals  It should remain an argument among friends  each of us struggling to hear our conscience  and heed its demands  each of us  despite our differences  united in our great cause  and respectful of the goodness in each other  I have not always heeded this injunction myself  and I regret it very much   I had a friend once  who  a long time ago  in the passions and resentments of a tumultuous era in our history  I might have considered my enemy  He had come once to the capitol of the country that held me prisoner  that deprived me and my dearest friends of our most basic rights  and that murdered some of us  He came to that place to denounce our country s involvement in the war that had led us there  His speech was broadcast into our cells  I thought it a grievous wrong then  and I still do   A few years later  he had moved temporarily to a kibbutz in Israel  He was there during the Yom Kippur War  when he witnessed the support America provided our beleaguered ally  He saw the huge cargo planes bearing the insignia of the United States Air Force rushing emergency supplies into that country  And he had an epiphany  He had believed America had made a tragic mistake by going to Vietnam  and he still did  He had seen what he believed were his country s faults  and he still saw them  But he realized he had let his criticism temporarily blind him to his country s generosity and the goodness that most Americans possess  and he regretted his failing deeply  When he returned to his country he became prominent in Democratic Party politics  and helped elect Bill Clinton President of the United States  He still criticized his government when he thought it wrong  but he never again lost sight of all that unites us   We met some years later  He approached me and asked to apologize for the mistake he believed he had made as a young man  Many years had passed since then  and I bore little animosity for anyone because of what they had done or not done during the Vietnam War  It was an easy thing to accept such a decent act  and we moved beyond our old grievance   We worked together in an organization dedicated to promoting human rights in the country where he and I had once come for different reasons  I came to admire him for his generosity  his passion for his ideals  for the largeness of his heart  and I realized he had not been my enemy  but my countryman       my countryman       and later my friend  His friendship honored me  We disagreed over much  Our politics were often opposed  and we argued those disagreements  But we worked together for our shared ideals  We were not always in the right  but we weren t always in the wrong either  and we defended our beliefs as we had each been given the wisdom to defend them   David remained my countryman and my friend  until the day of his death  at the age of forty seven  when he left a loving wife and three beautiful children  and legions of friends behind him  His country was a better place for his service to her  and I had become a better man for my friendship with him  God bless him   And may God bless you  Class of 2006  The world does indeed await you  and humanity is impatient for your service  Take good care of that responsibility  Everything depends upon it   And thank you  very much  for the privilege of sharing this great occasion with you                                                     May 2006 Press Releases           Browse by
