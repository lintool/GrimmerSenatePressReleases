troops  rejects political micromanagement  March 15  2007 Washington  D C   The U S  Senate and U S  Senator Mike Enzi  R Wyo   expressed support for our nations troops and passed two resolutions solidifying the intent of the body to continue providing resources to our men and women in uniform  The Senate also rejected a resolution introduced by Majority Leader Harry Reid  D Nev   that called for a time line to pull troops out of Iraq   The Constitution is quite clear  Congress must be consulted before any large scale military operation is begun  But once that has been done  the Commander in Chief of our Armed Forces  the President  is to direct the effort that we approved  said Enzi  I would like to have each and every one of our troops back home with their families and friends immediately  We cannot  however  pull our troops out of Iraq at this point without facing extremely dire consequences for a long time to come    Statement on    Iraq Resolution  Senator Michael B  Enzi  March 15  2007  Mr  President  As I begin my comments on the resolutions we have under consideration  I want to first make very clear my strong support for the members of our armed forces and the vital work they are doing around the world every day  I have the greatest admiration for them all for their heartfelt commitment to preserving our freedoms and maintaining our national security  They are all true heroes and they are the ones who are doing the heavy lifting and making great sacrifices in our name so that we might continue to be the land of the free and the home of the brave  Over the years  I have been to Iraq and I have met with the members of our armed forces there and  later  here in the   United States when they have returned home  These remarkable men and women exemplify the best qualities of our nation  They volunteered to serve in the best trained force in the world and they deserve our complete and unwavering support  If it were possible  I would like to have each and every one of our troops back home with their families and friends immediately  We cannot  however  pull our troops out of   Iraq at this point without facing extremely dire consequences for a long time to come  I have spoken at length to our troops about their mission and they understand their mission   I was thinking about them  and all the members of our military who are presently serving around the world as I began to prepare my remarks  I thought back to the days  years ago  when I was first elected to serve as the Mayor of   Gillette  Wyoming   I made a habit of carrying around a copy of the Constitution with me everywhere I went  I kept it in my coat pocket  next to my pen  and whenever I looked at it  it reminded me of two things  the government I was a part of  and the people I was elected to serve      Then  when I came here to the Senate  the Constitution took on an even greater  deeper meaning for me  I now saw it as my job description  That is why I make sure to always keep it handy so it can continue to serve as a reminder of the detailed portrait it contains of our federal government and how it was designed to work by our Founding Fathers  Today  it provides us with a good starting point for our debate and it provides some of the answers to the issues before us      The relevant parts of the Constitution are quite clear  Congress must be consulted before any large scale military operation is begun  But once that has been done  the Commander in Chief of our Armed Forces  the President  is to direct the effort that we approved      The Founding Fathers had a good reason for establishing the President as the Commander in Chief of our Armed Forces and the one who is responsible for making the decisions affecting the actions of our nations military      That doesnt mean that Congress has no role to play in these decisions  We all have an important role to play when it comes to matters like these  Again  in their great wisdom  the drafters of our Constitution knew that Congress could  and should  influence policy  but they knew it would be impossible for us to have all the information available to the President to debate and assess before making a decision on the viability of every military operation  The process of determining military strategy would be a nightmare if we were to be expected to debate all the intricacies of every policy and  by so doing  reveal some of the information obtained by our intelligence agencies on the House and Senate floor before reaching a decision  Our procedure on the Floor is a good process for debating and considering legislation  but its a process that doesnt lend itself well to producing a quick and informed military decision at a time of crisis     Those thoughts were on my mind when the President put forward a new strategy for us to pursue in   Iraq   recognizing that what we are currently doing is not working  General David Petraeus  our U S  Commander in    Iraq   testified before us about that policy  He is consulting with highly educated and trained members of the military  many from universities where criticism of U S  efforts in    Iraq has flourished  It is evident that the President and his advisors are seeking analysis and recommendations from people who recognize the fact that the road ahead will be complicated and difficult      Listening to the debate  I have heard many of my colleagues sum up the Presidents new strategy as just increasing the number of American troops in   Iraq   I dont believe it is a matter of numbers  The real question should be what the placement of these troops is designed to accomplish  There is no question that there must be a clearly defined mission for them on the ground  By having more forces on the ground  we may be able to decrease the vulnerability of our troops as they move from place to place  That will provide them with the backup and protection they need to more safely pursue their mission    In the months to come  it is clear that there are several things the new policy must do if it is to be successful  First and foremost  the new campaign must provide the security the people of   Iraq must have to feel safe at home  If they do not feel secure under the protection of the   United States   coalition  and Iraqi forces  they will turn toward terrorist organizations that will prey on their fears and provide a false sense of security  Americas long term security interests and the possibility of world peace will be best served by an   Iraq that can sustain  govern  and defend itself  while serving as an ally in the war against the terrorists     Looking long term  I think we would all agree that the future of Iraq will directly affect the balance of power in the    Middle East   That is why countries throughout the region are watching to see what action we will take in   Iraq   An immediate withdrawal of   United States and coalition forces will leave our allies in the region forced to prepare for additional conflicts      Our mission in   Iraq has not been easy  and it will not get easier in the days to come  After all  we are facing centuries old difficulties as we work with the people of Iraq to help them overcome their religious and ethnic differences to form a nation that will work to benefit and protect all their people      Ultimately what the future of   Iraq will be is up to the Iraqi people themselves    Iraq must put together a working coalition of its three major groups  the Kurds  Sunnis  and Shia  as well as other ethnic and religious minorities  They must work for national reconciliation through shared responsibilities as well as shared oil revenues that will be used to solve the problems that exist in their own backyard  Such a reconciliation will not only be good for Iraq  but the    Middle East as a whole      Looking back  the record is clear  Like many members of the United States Senate  I supported the original decision in 2002 to take action against Saddam Hussein in   Iraq   The vote I cast that day was not an easy decision  The tough ones are like that  You make the best decision you can  based on the information you have on hand at the time you have to make it  Those are the decisions that make us all lose sleep for years afterward  Anytime you vote to put our nations young men and women in harms way  it stays with you long after the fighting is over and our troops are on their way back home      Today  I remain concerned about the safety of the people on the ground  Americans  coalition allies  and the Iraqi people  And there is good reason for my concern  With todays rapid communication made possible by the Internet  cell phones  and other technologies  what we say here can almost instantaneously find its way around the world and straight to the camps of both friends and foes  and they are both watching  In fact  I dont think its an exaggeration to say that the whole world is watching to see what we will decide to do      Which leads me to ask  what do we hope to accomplish through this debate  We have already approved the nomination of General Petraeus by a unanimous vote  Now we are considering a resolution condemning a plan he hasnt had a chance to put into action yet  What sort of message will we send our troops with our vote on that      As members of the United States Senate  we have the opportunity to voice our opinions to the President and our constituents  But the fact that we are even going through this debate at this point in time may give those who wish to do us harm hope and embolden them  and once emboldened they will pose an even greater threat to our troops      As we continue with our consideration of these resolutions  I want to be clear that I do not want to cut funding for the troops  Their safety and their very lives depend on that funding  When you are in a war  you dont do that to the troops      Looking ahead  in the months to come  Congress must continue to closely monitor the actions of the new Iraqi government  our military leaders  and our civilian leaders  We should continue to express our opinions  and take whatever actions are necessary to ensure our troops are provided the best support possible so that they can come home soon  We should not  however  further endanger the lives of Americans and Iraqis simply to make a statement and take a stand against the President                                                      March 2007 News Releases           Browse by
