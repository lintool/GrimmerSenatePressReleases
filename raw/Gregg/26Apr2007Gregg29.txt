Senator Gregg Supports Troops  Votes Against Excessive Spending That Limits Their Capabilities And Funds Unrelated Domestic Projects  Contact Erin Rath Laena Fallon  WASHINGTON  DC U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH  today voted against the Fiscal Year 2007 spending measure  which was intended to fund the troops fighting the war on terror  but instead was used to carry inappropriate and unconstitutional language limiting the capabilities of the troops  as well as being used as a vehicle for billions of dollars of federal funds for domestic spending unrelated to the war   Senator Gregg stated  Today  the Senate voted on a resolution relative to the funding of the troops in Iraq  Unfortunately  the resolution has been filled with conditions put in there by the Democratic leadership  which absolutely guarantee that the troops in the field will not be able to accomplish their mission  I cannot vote for language of this nature  It is language that absolutely guarantees defeat  As a practical matter  the Majority Leader of the Senate  the Democratic Leader  has said that weve lost this war and this language is going to assure that his statement is accomplished  There are obviously significant problems in Iraq  but putting the Congress in the position of managing the war on the ground is not the right approach  We should not be limiting our Commanders discretion in this way and we certainly should be giving the resources to the troops that they need in order to pursue their mission and remain safe     Yesterday  Senator Gregg spoke on the floor of the U S  Senate regarding the supplemental spending bill and the language setting out a withdrawal time line for Iraq  The following is a full transcript of that statement  U S  Senator Judd Gregg  R NH   Floor Statement  Wednesday  April 25  2007  IRAQ TROOP WITHDRAWAL  Mr  GREGG  Mr  President  I believe it is appropriate to respond to the assistant leader on the Democratic side relative to his commentary because this is obviously an issue of significance  probably the most significant issue we face as a nation today in the area of concern for our citizens who are carrying the burden of service and who wear the uniform of America   I do think it is a touch cynical for the other side of the aisle to come to the floor of the Senate and say they are going to support the troops  when only 3 months into General Petraeus s leadership in Iraq they are suggesting that the rug should be pulled out from underneath his efforts  General Petraeus was sent there with an overwhelming vote of this body in support of his efforts to try to bring stability  specifically to Baghdad  and to give the Government of Iraq  which was freely elected  something which the other side of the aisle manages to ignore with a fair amount of energy  to give them the breathing space they need in order to be able to get going and to be able to create stability   A stable Iraq is critical to our national defense  and it is critical to our ability to fight terrorism  A unilateral withdrawal forced upon us by the Democratic leadership of this Congress within the next 3 months  which is the proposal they put into the language of this bill  will guarantee that Iraq goes into chaos  It will probably guarantee that thousands  tens of thousands of Iraqis will die as a result of genocidal activity or activity that will border on genocide  and that will make the Balkans look like it was minor in comparison to Iraq as far as chaos  It will establish without doubt a client state for Iran  probably partitioned within Iraq  It will clearly create functioning safe havens for al Qaida  which has sworn  of course  to attack America on American soil  and has already done so and has proven its ability to do this   The fact that after only 3 months of General Petraeus being in the field we would pull from beneath him the ability to support the troops he needs there is really  in my opinion  an act of cynicism  The plan is set up in a manner  the language which was put into this plan is set up in a manner so that the Iraqi Government must meet 16 major goals in restructuring its Government within 2 1 2 months  My goodness  the Congress of the United States  the Senate of the United States can t pass anything in 2 1 2 months  Yet we expect the Iraqi Government and Legislature to reorganize its entire structure within 2 1 2 months   That is the condition put in this bill in order to maintain funds for our troops who are in the field  If the Iraqi Government is unable to meet those conditions  then within 3 months the money is withdrawn from the troops in the field  General Petraeus s flexibility is removed  and he is essentially handcuffed  The commanders in the field are no longer the generals in the field  It is no longer General Petraeus and his colonels and lieutenant colonels  his captains and his lieutenants  The commanders become the leadership of the other side of the aisle  They make the decisions on military action within Baghdad  General Petraeus s hands will be tied behind him  or at least one hand will be tied behind him   Even if the Iraqi Government did the amazing thing of putting in place all these  significant conditions  and there should be conditions  no question  benchmarks for Iraq  these fairly significant conditions in a compressed timeframe  which guarantees they will not be accomplished  but let s say even if that Government were able to succeed in those conditions  then what is the reward for putting in place that type of stability and that type of restructuring  The language in the bill requires that the troops begin to be withdrawn and the money start to be cut off 3 months later  They are giving them a 3 month breathing space of having the support they need and General Petraeus having the support he needs in order to accomplish his goals   The other side of the aisle comes to the floor of the Senate and acts as if these are not significant  that we are not putting in place things which can t be accomplished  that we want to support the troops in the field  Well  read the conditions  The conditions cannot be met  and they are intentionally structured not to be met  Listen to the real language from the other side of the aisle   The majority leader says the war is lost  He wasn t talking just about Iraq  It appears he was talking about the entire war against terrorism  which happens to be a fairly significant statement  It is also obvious that when you make a statement like that  as the leader of the Democratic Party  the most senior Democratic Member of the Senate  one of the most senior Members of the Democratic leadership of the Government of this country  when you say the war is lost  you put your credibility on the line     Quite honestly  if we institute the language as proposed in this bill  which dramatically limits the capacity of General Petraeus and the American troops to succeed in their mission  well  I guess that will probably guarantee the war is lost  so they will have a self fulfilling prophecy as relates to Iraq  The consequences of that will be catastrophic in the area of death and destruction within Iraq   For us  as a nation and for our national security  should a client state be created for Iran within Iraq  should al Qaida have free haven in Iraq  the consequences for us could be equally dramatic   In addition  a little point should be made here  The language in this bill  as it is being brought forward  is blatantly unconstitutional  It essentially cedes responsibility for the management of the troops in the field to the legislative branch  Nowhere in the Constitution did the Founding Fathers believe there should be 435 people running military decisions in the field  They had just been through a war  They had been through the revolution  where they had one person running the army in the field  George Washington  They understood that you either put one person in charge or you have chaos in any sort of military action  That is why the Constitution says the Commander in Chief shall be the President  and that the military shall report to the Commander in Chief   The language of this bill  on its face  is clearly unconstitutional because it essentially cedes responsibility for field command over our troops to the leadership of the Senate  the Democratic leadership of the Senate  ironically  which guarantees chaos in the area of order relative to defining and executing the mission as assigned to the troops in the field  You can t say to the American soldier  who is on the ground in Iraq  who is in Baghdad  who is doing their mission  and doing their mission well  very  very well  and General Petraeus has said there is progress occurring there  you can t say to that soldier  A  we are going to take the money away from you to support your mission  B  we are going to give your enemies a defined date when we are going to leave so that your enemies  our enemies  can wait you out and can basically harass you knowing that you are going to withdraw  and  C  that your new commander is the majority leader and the assistant leader of the Senate and the Speaker of the House   We can t say  When General Petraeus gives you a command  you don t necessarily have to listen to him because the people who are going to make the decision as to how you execute your mission aren t in the line of authority of the military or the Commander in Chief  they have suddenly become the legislative branch of the Government   The language in this bill is structured to accomplish one thing  and that is to assure defeat in our efforts to try to bring about a stable and responsible Government in Iraq  All you have to do to confirm the logic of that view and the accuracy of that view is to return to the words of the majority leader  The war is lost  he said  In order to assure that happens  they have brought forth the language in this bill which guarantees that our enemy will know when we are going to leave  that the freely elected Government of Iraq will not get the support it needs to survive as a stable and responsible Government  and that our soldiers will not know who is commanding them  but they will know they are not going to get the necessary support to accomplish their mission  That is defeat   Mr  President  I yield the floor
