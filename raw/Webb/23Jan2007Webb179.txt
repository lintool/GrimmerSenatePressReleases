Jim Webb to the President s State of the Union Address                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Tuesday  January 23  2007      Good evening         I   m Senator Jim Webb  from Virginia  where this year we will celebrate the 400th anniversary of the settlement of Jamestown     an event that marked the first step in the long journey that has made us the greatest and most prosperous nation on earth       It would not be possible in this short amount of time to actually rebut the President   s message  nor would it be useful   Let me simply say that we in the Democratic Party hope that this administration is serious about improving education and healthcare for all Americans  and addressing such domestic priorities as restoring the vitality of New Orleans         Further  this is the seventh time the President has mentioned energy independence in his state of the union message  but for the first time this exchange is taking place in a Congress led by the Democratic Party   We are looking for affirmative solutions that will strengthen our nation by freeing us from our dependence on foreign oil  and spurring a wave of entrepreneurial growth in the form of alternate energy programs   We look forward to working with the President and his party to bring about these changes       There are two areas where our respective parties have largely stood in contradiction  and I want to take a few minutes to address them tonight   The first relates to how we see the health of our economy     how we measure it  and how we ensure that its benefits are properly shared among all Americans  The second regards our foreign policy     how we might bring the war in Iraq to a proper conclusion that will also allow us to continue to fight the war against international terrorism  and to address other strategic concerns that our country faces around the world       When one looks at the health of our economy  it   s almost as if we are living in two different countries   Some say that things have never been better  The stock market is at an all time high  and so are corporate profits  But these benefits are not being fairly shared   When I graduated from college  the average corporate CEO made 20 times what the average worker did  today  it   s nearly 400 times   In other words  it takes the average worker more than a year to make the money that his or her boss makes in one day         Wages and salaries for our workers are at all time lows as a percentage of national wealth  even though the productivity of American workers is the highest in the world   Medical costs have skyrocketed   College tuition rates are off the charts  Our manufacturing base is being dismantled and sent overseas   Good American jobs are being sent along with them         In short  the middle class of this country  our historic backbone and our best hope for a strong society in the future  is losing its place at the table   Our workers know this  through painful experience   Our white collar professionals are beginning to understand it  as their jobs start disappearing also  And they expect  rightly  that in this age of globalization  their government has a duty to insist that their concerns be dealt with fairly in the international marketplace       In the early days of our republic  President Andrew Jackson established an important principle of American style democracy     that we should measure the health of our society not at its apex  but at its base   Not with the numbers that come out of Wall Street  but with the living conditions that exist on Main Street   We must recapture that spirit today         And under the leadership of the new Democratic Congress  we are on our way to doing so   The House just passed a minimum wage increase  the first in ten years  and the Senate will soon follow   We ve introduced a broad legislative package designed to regain the trust of the American people   We   ve established a tone of cooperation and consensus that extends beyond party lines   We   re working to get the right things done  for the right people and for the right reasons        With respect to foreign policy  this country has patiently endured a mismanaged war for nearly four years   Many  including myself  warned even before the war began that it was unnecessary  that it would take our energy and attention away from the larger war against terrorism  and that invading and occupying Iraq would leave us strategically vulnerable in the most violent and turbulent corner of the world         I want to share with all of you a picture that I have carried with me for more than 50 years    This is my father  when he was a young Air Force captain  flying cargo planes during the Berlin Airlift   He sent us the picture from Germany  as we waited for him  back here at home   When I was a small boy  I used to take the picture to bed with me every night  because for more than three years my father was deployed  unable to live with us full time  serving overseas or in bases where there was no family housing   I still keep it  to remind me of the sacrifices that my mother and others had to make  over and over again  as my father gladly served our country  I was proud to follow in his footsteps  serving as a Marine in Vietnam   My brother did as well  serving as a Marine helicopter pilot   My son has joined the tradition  now serving as an infantry Marine in Iraq         Like so many other Americans  today and throughout our history  we serve and have served  not for political reasons  but because we love our country   On the political issues     those matters of war and peace  and in some cases of life and death     we trusted the judgment of our national leaders   We hoped that they would be right  that they would measure with accuracy the value of our lives against the enormity of the national interest that might call upon us to go into harm   s way         We owed them our loyalty  as Americans  and we gave it   But they owed us     sound judgment  clear thinking  concern for our welfare  a guarantee that the threat to our country was equal to the price we might be called upon to pay in defending it       The President took us into this war recklessly   He disregarded warnings from the national security adviser during the first Gulf War  the chief of staff of the army  two former commanding generals of the Central Command  whose jurisdiction includes Iraq   the director of operations on the Joint Chiefs of Staff  and many  many others with great integrity and long experience in national security affairs   We are now  as a nation  held hostage to the predictable     and predicted     disarray that has followed         The war   s costs to our nation have been staggering    Financially    The damage to our reputation around the world    The lost opportunities to defeat the forces of international terrorism    And especially the precious blood of our citizens who have stepped forward to serve       The majority of the nation no longer supports the way this war is being fought  nor does the majority of our military   We need a new direction   Not one step back from the war against international terrorism   Not a precipitous withdrawal that ignores the possibility of further chaos   But an immediate shift toward strong regionally based diplomacy  a policy that takes our soldiers off the streets of Iraq   s cities  and a formula that will in short order allow our combat forces to leave Iraq       On both of these vital issues  our economy and our national security  it falls upon those of us in elected office to take action         Regarding the economic imbalance in our country  I am reminded of the situation President Theodore Roosevelt faced in the early days of the 20th century   America was then  as now  drifting apart along class lines   The so called robber barons were unapologetically raking in a huge percentage of the national wealth   The dispossessed workers at the bottom were threatening revolt         Roosevelt spoke strongly against these divisions   He told his fellow Republicans that they must set themselves    as resolutely against improper corporate influence on the one hand as against demagogy and mob rule on the other     And he did something about it       As I look at Iraq  I recall the words of former general and soon to be President Dwight Eisenhower during the dark days of the Korean War  which had fallen into a bloody stalemate      When comes the end     asked the General who had commanded our forces in Europe during World War Two   And as soon as he became President  he brought the Korean War to an end       These Presidents took the right kind of action  for the benefit of the American people and for the health of our relations around the world   Tonight we are calling on this President to take similar action  in both areas   If he does  we will join him   If he does not  we will be showing him the way       Thank you for listening   And God bless America
