STATEMENT ON 24TH ANNIVERSARY OF BOMBING OF MARINE CORPS BARRACKS IN BEIRUT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Washington  DC   Senator Jim  Webb yesterday delivered the following remarks on the Senate  floor to memorialize the 24th anniversary of the bombing of the  Marine Corps Barracks in Beirut in 1983    Twenty four years ago today  at 6 20 in the morning   in Beirut  a yellow Mercedes Benz truck drove  into the Beirut International Airport  where the 1st Battalion 8th  Marines was keeping its headquarters  The truck crashed through a barbed wire  fence  went through the parking lot  passed between two sentry posts  and then  crashed through a gate and into the lobby of the large building where the  Marines were keeping their headquarters    At that point  the explosives were set off in this  truck  ending up with the deaths of 241 American military service members  This  was the largest loss of life for the U S  Marine Corps in one single day since  Iwo Jima  It was the largest loss of life in  one day for American service people from the beginning of the Tet Offensive of  31 January 1968  and it remains the largest single loss of life in one day since  that time     I believe it is appropriate for us to take a few minutes  and remember today the sacrifices that were made and the contributions the  United States was attempting to make in that particular circumstance     I make these comments as someone who is proud to have  served in the U S  Marine Corps  who has a brother who served in the Marine  Corps  who has a son who is now serving in the Marine Corps  and as someone who  covered the Marines in Beirut as a journalist and had recently left the country  when this incident occurred     The Marines who went to Beirut came in peace  They  had been sent in after several incidents occurred regarding multiparty  incidents  which I will describe in a minute  at the request of the Lebanese  Government  We had a U S  Marine Corps representation  We had military people  from the United Kingdom   Italy  and France  They were asked to help  separate the warring factions inside Beirut during a vicious civil war and also to  help separate the end result of an Israeli incursion  in which the Israelis were  attempting to take out large elements of the Palestinian Liberation  Organization    So our Marines began this visibility presence in  September of 1982  They had been there through different cycles of rotation for  a little more than a year when this event occurred     They operated under enormously difficult rules of  engagement  The situation in Beirut at that time  was rather similar to what we see in Iraq today in terms of having a weak  central government and many different factions around it     On any given day  our Marines in Beirut could be bumping  up against Shia militia  Sunni militia  Christian Phalange  Druze militia  the  Syrians over the border on one side    as well as with French  U K   and Italian  military units all operating in this environment  The Israeli military  which  at this point had pulled back over the Chouf mountains  also was present     These were very fine Marines  I spent a good bit of  time with them at their different positions  They were overall commanded by  Col  Tim Geraghty  an extraordinarily capable officer who had spent more than  two tours in Vietnam  Their battalion commander   Lt  Col  Howard Gerlach  had done a tour and a half in Vietnam  as infantry leader    The rules of engagement were so strict in Beirut at the time that  when our Marines took fire  they could only return fire with the same type of  weapon they were receiving fire from  These very restrictive rules ended up  contributing to the situation in which the truck bomb went off  The sentries at  the gate where the truck came in were not even allowed to have ammunition in  their weapons at that time  They were precluded from being able to take out  this truck when it entered because once they saw what was happening  they had to  attempt to load their weapons and then fire at it     This was an incident  which combines so many different factors that are still in play right now in the  Middle East  We should be remembering it  We  should be remembering when we look back on it that the United  States must play its hand very carefully in  that part of the world  As one Marine said to me during a firefight at one  outpost I was covering as a journalist     It is always difficult when you get involved in a  five sided argument    We ought to think about that when we are looking at what  is going on in other parts of the Middle East  today     But the main purpose of me speaking today is to urge all  of us never to forget the courage and the risk and  ultimately  the sacrifice  that so many of our young people are required to make on behalf of our country  and under the direction of the leadership of those who decide to send them into  harm s way
