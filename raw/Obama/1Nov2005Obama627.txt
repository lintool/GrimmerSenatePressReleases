Statement of U S  Senator Barack Obama on the Avian Flu Tuesday  October 18  2005  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Obama Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green     Date  October 18  2005  Statement of U S  Senator Barack Obama on the Avian Flu  Remarks as prepared for delivery on the U S  Senate floor  Washington  DC  October 18  2005   Mr  President    We are continuing to witness the relentless spread of avian flu  carried slowly but predictably by wild  migratory birds from countries in Southeast Asia to Western China  to Mongolia  and then over the Ural Mountains into Russia and Ukraine   From there  avian flu has spread over the past week to Romania and Turkey  and we have just learned  possibly into Greece    Dr  Joseph Domenech  chief of the Animal Health Service at the United Nation s Food and Agriculture Organization  has been quoted as saying that     we are not surprised     Mr  President  at this point  no one should be surprised   The experts have told us repeatedly that a flu pandemic is inevitable  although the timing is unpredictable   In other words  the question is not if  but when  This spread of avian flu is our warning signal  and we need to heed this call to action       If we re lucky  we ll have at least a year  or perhaps several years  to prepare for a flu pandemic   But we might not be so lucky   And regardless of whether it is this particular strain of avian flu  H5N1  or another deadly strain  the time to act is long overdue if we want to prevent unprecedented human suffering  death  and economic devastation    International health experts say that two of the three conditions for an avian flu pandemic in Southeast Asia already exist    First  a new strain of the virus has emerged to which humans have little or no immunity   Second  this strain has shown that it can jump between species    The last condition  the ability for the virus to travel efficiently from human to human  has not been met  and it is the only thing preventing a full blown pandemic    Once this virus mutates and can be transmitted from human to human  we will not be able to contain this disease   Because of the wonders of modern travel  a person could board a plane in Bangkok  Athens  or Bucharest and land in Chicago less than a day later  unknowingly carrying the virus   Indeed  we learned this lesson from SARS  which moved quickly from Asia to Canada  where it led to many deaths    As my colleagues know  one of my top priorities since arriving in the Senate has been increasing awareness about the avian flu   In April of this year  I introduced the AVIAN Act  which is a comprehensive bill to increase our preparedness for an avian flu pandemic   This bill was incorporated into a larger bill  the Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act  that Senator Reid and I introduced two weeks ago   We need to move this bill as quickly as possible    We also need to provide more funding to purchase vaccines and antivirals and improve our ability to spot and isolate a pandemic as soon as it begins   In the spring and summer  I worked to secure  35 million in funding to fight the avian flu   Today  some of this money is already helping the World Health Organization to step up its international surveillance and response efforts    But clearly much more money is needed   Last month  I joined Senator Harkin and others in offering an amendment to the DOD appropriations bill to provide almost  4 billion to fight the avian flu   I am pleased that Senator Stevens cosponsored the amendment and it was accepted into the appropriations bill   I hope that the House will agree to this funding in conference     Although we have begun to step up to the plate in the Senate  it is unfortunate that none of the avian flu bills that have been introduced have passed into law   Frankly  there s been a lot of talk  but not enough action   And this isn t just true of the Congress    One year after publishing the draft pandemic flu plan  the Administration has still not released the final HHS Pandemic Flu Preparedness Plan   Half of states haven t published plans either  and we know that many of these states will need substantial help    This lack of planning is compounded by the fact that we still don t have a FDA approved vaccine against avian flu  and the one drug that many countries are relying on  Tamiflu  may be less effective than experts had thought     The manufacturer is also struggling to meet the demand  and it could take up to 2 years for it to make enough for the U S  stockpile  presuming this Administration finally puts in an order for the drug    I would ask my colleagues how many hearings and briefings that they have sat through where witnesses and experts have urged the United States government to be better prepared for these types of crises     The failure to prepare for emergencies can have devastating consequences   We learned that lesson the hard way after Hurricane Katrina   This nation must not be caught off guard when faced with the prospect of an avian flu pandemic   The consequences are too high    The flyways for migratory birds are well established   We know that avian flu will likely hit the United States in a matter of time   With the regular flu season coming up shortly  conditions will be favorable for reassortment of the avian flu virus with the annual flu virus   Such reassortment could lead to a mutated virus that could be transmitted efficiently between humans  which is the last condition needed for pandemic flu    The question is will we be ready when that happens   Let s make sure that answer is yes   I urge my colleagues in the Senate and the House to push this Administration to take the action needed to prevent a catastrophe that we have not seen during our lifetimes    Thank you   I yield the floor
