   Obama  Culture in Washington Must Change  Implement Tough Ethics Reform   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                          Obama  Culture in Washington Must Change  Implement Tough Ethics Reform Thursday  August  2  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    CONTACT  Ben LaBolt WASHINGTON  D C     U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today delivered the following remarks on the Senate floor in support of the Honest Government and Leadership Act   This legislation would provide increased transparency and accountability  reduce the influence of lobbyists and special interests  and bring about the concrete changes we need in Washington   In January  Obama joined with Senator Russ Feingold  D WI  to introduce Lobbying and Ethics Reform Act  which set a standard for strong ethics legislation this Congress   Obama also sponsored an amendment to the Honest Government and Open Leadership Act that required the disclosure of lobbyists that bundle campaign contributions for candidates  Senator Obama  s remarks are below    First  let me commend Senator Reid for his leadership on this bill and especially my good friend Senator Feingold  who I have worked closely with on this issue over the past year and a half          The bill that  s before us today could not be more urgently needed   For too long  the American people have seen lobbyists treat the legislative process like a game  using targeted contributions to maximize their leverage   For too long  people have felt like their voice and their interests have been drowning in a sea of lobbyist money in Washington         This is not the first time we have faced a crisis of confidence in government  Around the turn of the last century  wealth was becoming more concentrated in the hands of a few robber barons  railroad tycoons and oil magnates   It was an era known as the Gilded Age  and it was made possible by a government that played along        But when President Theodore Roosevelt took office  he wouldn  t play along   He devoted his presidency to busting trusts  breaking up monopolies  and doing his best to give the American people a shot at the American dream once more        America needs this kind of leadership more than ever   We need leadership that sees government not as a tool to enrich well connected friends and high priced lobbyists  but as the defender of fairness and opportunity for every American         We cannot settle for a second Gilded Age in America   And yet we find ourselves once more in the midst of a new economy where more wealth is in danger of falling into fewer hands  where CEO pay grows from year to year as the average worker  s pay remains stagnant  where Americans are struggling like never before to pay their medical bills  or their kids   tuition  or high gas prices  all while the profits of the drug and insurance and oil industries have never been higher       And once again  we are faced with a politics that makes all of this possible   In recent years  the doors of Congress and the White House have been thrown wide open to an army of Washington lobbyists who have turned our government into a game only they can afford to play  Year after year after year  they stand in the way of our progress as a country   They stop us from addressing the issues that matter most to our people        Take health care   The drug and insurance industries spent  1 billion in lobbying over the last decade   They got what they paid for when their friends in Congress broke the rules and twisted arms to push through a prescription drug bill that actually made it illegal for our own government to negotiate with the pharmaceutical companies for cheaper drug prices        And because reform has been blocked up to now  there are parents and grandparents in this country who are walking into a drugstore and wondering how their Social Security check is going to cover a prescription that  s more expensive than it was a month ago  those who are being forced to choose between their medicine and their groceries because they can no longer afford both          Let me be clear  I do not begrudge businesses for trying to make a profit  and I do not begrudge them for hiring lobbyists to plead their case before Congress   It is protected political speech  and we appreciate that there are many lobbyists who represent their clients well and fairly  But it  s time we had a Congress that tells the drug companies and the oil companies and the insurance industry that while they may get a seat at the table in Washington  they don  t get to buy every chair        We need to put an end to the prevailing culture in this town   And that  s what we  ve been trying to do for the past couple of years   Last year  Congress came up with a watered down version of reform   Last year  I and Senator Feingold and Senator McCain  voted against it because we thought we could do better   So in January  I came back with Senator Feingold and we set a high bar for reform   And I  m pleased to report that the bill before us today comes very close to what we proposed        By passing this bill  we will ban gifts and meals and end subsidized travel on corporate jets   We will close the revolving door between Pennsylvania Avenue and K Street   And we will make sure that the American people could see all the pet projects that lawmakers are trying to pass before they are actually voted on         And we  ll do something more   Over the objections of powerful voices in both parties  we  ll ensure that our laws shine a bright light on how lobbyists help fill the campaign coffers of members of Congress by bundling contributions from others   Because in an era in which soft money is prohibited  the real measure of a lobbyist  s influence isn  t how much money he  s contributed  it  s how much he  s raised from others       For too long  this practice has been hidden from public view   But today  we can change that   I  m pleased that the amendment I  ve offered on bundling is part of this bill  and I want to thank Rep  Chris Van Hollen who has fought so hard to get this provision included in the House bill  As the Washington Post described the bundling provision earlier this year     No single change would add more to public understanding of how money really operates in Washington         So there  s a lot of good in this bill  and I truly hope and believe that it will change the way we do business in Washington   Let  s not forget that there  s more we need to do       One of the things I  ve argued is the necessity of an independent entity to enforce ethics rules in Congress   Because no matter how well we police our own conduct  so long as we  re our own prosecutor  judge  and jury  the public will never have complete trust in our decisions   So far  that  s a fight I  ve lost  but I  ll continue to support independent enforcement because I believe it  s in our nation  s best interests         I also believe that if we  re serious about change  we need to have a real discussion about public financing for congressional elections   Because even if we can stop lobbyists from buying us lunch or taking us out on junkets  they  ll still be able to attend our fundraisers    and that  s access the average American doesn  t have        In our democracy  the price of access and influence should be nothing more than your voice and your vote   That should be enough for health care reform   That should be enough for a real energy policy   That should be enough to ensure that our government is still the defender of fairness and opportunity for every American         It  s time to show the American people that we have the courage to change the prevailing culture in this city   It  s time to give people confidence in their government again  And we have the chance to start doing that with this bill   So I proudly support this legislation
