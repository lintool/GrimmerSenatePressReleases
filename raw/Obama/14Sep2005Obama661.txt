       Lugar and Obama Urge Destruction of Conventional Weapons Stockpiles Tuesday  August 30  2005  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green     Date  August 30  2005  Lugar and Obama Urge Destruction of Conventional Weapons Stockpiles   DONETSK  Ukraine   U S  Senators Dick Lugar  R IN  and Barack Obama  D IL  called for the immediate destruction of 15 000 tons of ammunition  400 000 small arms and light weapons  and 1 000 man portable air defense systems  MANPADS  or shoulder missile launchers that are often sought by terrorists    Lugar and Obama toured the Donetsk State Chemical Production Plant  a conventional weapons destruction facility where the U S  has taken the lead in a three year NATO program to destroy the weapons   Another 117 000 tons of ammunition and 1 1 million small arms and light weapons are slated for destruction within 12 years    So far  the U S  has contributed  2 1 million to the project  and Austria  Bulgaria  Luxembourg  Lithuania  Netherlands  Norway  Slovakia  Switzerland  and the United Kingdom have contributed  1 2 million    While the destruction is ready to begin  the Ukrainian Rada  parliament  first must pass a law exempting the foreign assistance from taxation   Lugar and Obama discussed this issue with Rada Speaker Volodymyr Lytvyn  Prime Minister Yuliya Tymoshenko and President Viktor Yushchenko in meetings yesterday   All three leaders indicated they would promote action before the March 2006 parliamentary elections     The visit underscores the importance of legislation Lugar and Obama have authored that would commit additional U S  resources and expand authorities in cooperative threat reduction of conventional weapons around the world   The bill is part of the Foreign Relations Authorization Bill that is pending in the Senate and will be introduced as a free standing bill by the senators this fall     We discussed MANPADS  landmines and other very highly dangerous explosives   Ukraine has huge stockpiles leftover from previous times that are dangerous to people of this country as well as the possibility for proliferation to other countries   Lugar said    We are working to obtain funds to secure and destroy these weapons in cooperative threat reduction   We are encouraging the U S  and Ukraine to work together and to obtain more funds   We came here to see the problem and the solution with our own eyes     By the late 1980 s  75 percent of all Ukraine s industrial capacity was used to produce Soviet weaponry  including strategic weapons   In June 1996  the Nunn Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program successfully achieved the removal of all 1 240 deployed SS 19 and SS 24 strategic nuclear warheads from Ukraine     Vast stocks of conventional munitions and military supplies have accumulated in Ukraine   Some of this stockpile dates from World War I and II  yet most dates from Cold War buildup and the stocks left behind by Soviet withdrawals from East Germany  the Czech Republic  Hungry and Poland   Obama said   We need to eliminate these stockpiles for the safety of the Ukrainian people and people around world  by keeping them out of conflicts around the world     Estimates by the NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency suggest a significant proliferation and public safety threat from the 7 million small arms and light weapons and 2 million tons of conventional ammunition stored in more than 80 depots across Ukraine   These depots were never designed to hold such large stockpiles and remain vulnerable to those seeking such weapons or their components  or to spontaneous detonation in some of the older and larger ammunition stockpiles     In March  the Foreign Relations Committee added the Lugar Disarmament Initiative  LDI  to the Foreign Affairs Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2006 and 2007   The LDI is modeled on the original Nunn Lugar Act   Its purpose is to provide the Department of State with a focused response to the threat posed by vulnerable stockpiles of conventional weapons around the world  including tactical missiles and MANPADS   Such missile systems could be used by terrorists to attack commercial airliners  military installations and government facilities in the U S  and abroad   Reports suggest that Al Qaeda has attempted to acquire these kinds of weapons   In addition  unsecured conventional weapons stockpiles are a major obstacle to peace  reconstruction and economic development in regions suffering from instability     This bill declares it to be the policy of the United States to seek out surplus and unguarded stocks of conventional armaments  including small arms and light weapons  and tactical missile systems for elimination or safeguarding   It authorizes the Department of State to carry out an accelerated global effort to destroy such weapons and to cooperate with allies and international organizations when possible   The Secretary of State is charged with devising a strategy for prioritizing  on a country by country basis  the obligation of funds in a global program of conventional arms elimination   Lastly  the Secretary is required to unify program planning  coordination and implementation of the strategy into one office at the State Department and to request a budget commensurate with the risk posed by these weapons    During the trip  the senators have inspected a nuclear warhead storage facility and missile destruction facility in Russia and biological laboratories in Russia and Ukraine   On Thursday  they will review sea interdiction exercises on the Caspian Sea in Azerbaijan      In 1991  Senator Lugar  R IN  and former Senator Sam Nunn  D GA  authored the Nunn Lugar Act  which established the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program  This program has provided U S  funding and expertise to help the former Soviet Union safeguard and dismantle its enormous stockpiles of nuclear  chemical and biological weapons  related materials  and delivery systems  In 1997  Lugar and Nunn were joined by Senator Pete Domenici  R NM  in introducing the Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act  which expanded Nunn Lugar authorities in the former Soviet Union and provided WMD expertise to first responders in American cities  In 2003  Congress adopted the Nunn Lugar Expansion Act  which authorized the Nunn Lugar program to operate outside the former Soviet Union to address proliferation threats  In October 2004  Nunn Lugar funds were used for the first time outside of the former Soviet Union to secure chemical weapons in Albania  under a Lugar led expansion of the program    The latest Nunn Lugar Scorecard shows that the program has deactivated or destroyed  6 760 nuclear warheads  587 ICBMs  483 ICBM silos  32 ICBM mobile missile launchers  150 bombers  789 nuclear air to surface missiles  436 submarine missile launchers  549 submarine launched missiles  28 nuclear submarines  and 194 nuclear test tunnels    Beyond the scorecard s nuclear elimination  the Nunn Lugar program secures and destroys chemical weapons  and works to reemploy scientists and facilities related to biological weapons in peaceful research initiatives  The International Science and Technology Centers  of which the United States is the leading sponsor  have engaged 58 000 former weapons scientists in peaceful work  The International Proliferation Prevention Program has funded 750 projects involving 14 000 former weapons scientists and created some 580 new peaceful high tech jobs  Ukraine  Belarus and Kazakhstan are nuclear weapons free as a result of cooperative efforts under the Nunn Lugar program  They otherwise would be the world s the third  forth and eighth largest nuclear weapons powers  respectively
