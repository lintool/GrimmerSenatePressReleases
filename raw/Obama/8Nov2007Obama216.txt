C  Byrd  Chairman  The Honorable Thad Cochran  Ranking Member  Committee on Appropriations  S 131  The Capitol  Washington  DC 20510    Dear Chairman Byrd and Senator Cochran    I am writing regarding the troubling news from Pakistan over the weekend that President Musharraf has declared a state of emergency and has engaged in widespread and illegal arrests and other measures    Pakistan is an important ally to the United States  and for this reason  I have been proud to support significant investments in its stability and economic development over the last several years   At the same time  however  the developments over the weekend raise very serious concerns about President Musharraf s commitment to return Pakistan to a democratic path    In reaction to this news from Pakistan  Secretary Rice has pledged to review U S  assistance to Pakistan   As you know  in the context of the programs funded by the State Department Foreign Operations appropriations bill  the Administration requested roughly  845 million dollars in the regular and supplemental appropriations for FY  08   I agree that a wholesale review of U S  assistance to Pakistan is warranted in light of these recent events  but I am not confident the Administration will conduct the thorough review this situation demands  and I believe aggressive Congressional oversight of this review is vital    As such  I am requesting that you use the Senate House conference on the Foreign Operations appropriations bill  which includes foreign military financing  bilateral economic assistance  democracy assistance  and development assistance for Pakistan  to make sure that U S  taxpayer investments in Pakistan are making clear our strong support for the Pakistani people and are advancing our interests in democracy and the fight against Taliban and al Qaeda extremists in the border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan    I would request  specifically  that the Committee continue funding for Pakistan in the Foreign Operations bill in the areas of counter terrorism funding  public education  health  micro enterprise development  humanitarian assistance  and democracy and rule of law programs  and temporarily suspend all other funding for Pakistan in the Foreign Operations bill until such time as the Administration certifies that its review of assistance is complete and certifies further that    1 None of our assistance is being used to repress the democratic aspirations of the people of Pakistan    2 Parliamentary elections have been scheduled  restrictions on the media imposed as a result of the state of emergency have been lifted  and those imprisoned or placed under house arrest as a result of state of emergency have been freed  and   3 The Government of Pakistan has developed a comprehensive strategy to root out Taliban and al Qaeda forces in northwest Pakistan    I thank you in advance for the consideration of my request    Sincerely   Barack Obama  United States Senator cc
