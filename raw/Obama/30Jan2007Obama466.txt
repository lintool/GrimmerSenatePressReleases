   Debunked Insight Magazine and Fox News Smear Campaign   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Debunked Insight Magazine and Fox News Smear Campaign Tuesday  January 23  2007  Contact  Tommy Vietor or Robert Gibbs  202 228 5511  Date  January 23  2007  Debunked Insight Magazine and Fox News Smear Campaign In the past week  many of you have read a now thoroughly debunked story by Insight Magazine  owned by the Washington Times  which cites unnamed sources close to a political campaign that claim Senator Obama was enrolled for    at least four years    in an Indonesian    Madrassa     The article says the    sources    believe the Madrassa was    espousing Wahhabism     a form of radical Islam  Insight Magazine published these allegations without a single named source  and without doing any independent reporting to confirm or deny the allegations  Fox News quickly parroted the charges  and Fox and Friends host Steve Doocy went so far as to ask     Why didn   t anybody ever mention that that man right there was raised     spent the first decade of his life  raised by his Muslim father     as a Muslim and was educated in a Madrassa     All of the claims about Senator Obama raised in the Insight Magazine piece were thoroughly debunked by CNN  which  instead of relying on unnamed sources  sent a reporter to Obama   s former school in Jakarta to check the facts    Video   If Doocy or the staff at Fox and Friends had taken the time to check their facts  or simply made a call to his office  they would have learned that Senator Obama was not educated in a Madrassa  was not raised as a Muslim  and was not raised by his father     an atheist Obama met once in his life before he died  Later in the day  Fox News host John Gibson again discussed the Insight Magazine story without any attempt to independently confirm the charges  All of the claims about Senator Obama   s faith and education raised in the Insight Magazine story and repeated on Fox News are false  Senator Obama was raised in a secular household in Indonesia by his stepfather and mother  Obama   s stepfather worked for a U S  oil company  and sent his stepson to two years of Catholic school  as well as two years of public school  As Obama described it     Without the money to go to the international school that most expatriate children attended  I went to local Indonesian schools and ran the streets with the children of farmers  servants  tailors  and clerks      The Audacity of Hope  p  274  To be clear  Senator Obama has never been a Muslim  was not raised a Muslim  and is a committed Christian who attends the United Church of Christ in Chicago  Furthermore  the Indonesian school Obama attended in Jakarta is a public school that is not and never has been a Madrassa  These malicious  irresponsible charges are precisely the kind of politics the American people have grown tired of  and that Senator Obama is trying to change by focusing on bringing people together to solve our common problems  Below please find facts and citations rebutting the claims in the Insight Magazine story to help inform your editorial discussions about this issue  Attached also please find a letter from an ecumenical coalition of religious leaders denouncing this brand of negative

report about Obama Story Highlights     Report alleges Illinois senator attended radical Muslim school as a child     CNN reporter visits Indonesia school in question  sees no radicalism     Former classmate calls school  general   with multiple religions JAKARTA  Indonesia  CNN     Allegations that Sen  Barack Obama was educated in a radical Muslim school known as a  madrassa  are not accurate  according to CNN reporting  Insight Magazine  which is owned by the same company as The Washington Times  reported on its Web site last week that associates of Sen  Hillary Rodham Clinton  D New York  had unearthed information the Illinois Democrat and likely presidential candidate attended a Muslim religious school known for teaching the most fundamentalist form of Islam  Obama lived in Indonesia as a child  from 1967 to 1971  with his mother and stepfather and has acknowledged attending a Muslim school  but an aide said it was not a madrassa   Watch video of Obama s school  Insight attributed the information in its article to an unnamed source  who said it was discovered by  researchers connected to Senator Clinton   A spokesman for Clinton  who is also weighing a White House bid  denied that the campaign was the source of the Obama claim  He called the story  an obvious right wing hit job   Insight stood by its story in a response posted on its Web site Monday afternoon  The Insight article was cited several times Friday on Fox News and was also referenced by the New York Post  The Glenn Beck program on CNN Headline News and a number of political blogs   Watch how the Obama  gossip  spread  School not a madrassa But reporting by CNN in Jakarta  Indonesia and Washington  D C   shows the allegations that Obama attended a madrassa to be false  CNN dispatched Senior International Correspondent John Vause to Jakarta to investigate  He visited the Basuki school  which Obama attended from 1969 to 1971   This is a public school  We don t focus on religion   Hardi Priyono  deputy headmaster of the Basuki school  told Vause   In our daily lives  we try to respect religion  but we don t give preferential treatment   Vause reported he saw boys and girls dressed in neat school uniforms playing outside the school  while teachers were dressed in Western style clothes   I came here to Barack Obama s elementary school in Jakarta looking for what some are calling an Islamic madrassa     like the ones that teach hate and violence in Pakistan and Afghanistan   Vause said on the  Situation Room  Monday   I ve been to those madrassas in Pakistan     this school is nothing like that   Vause also interviewed one of Obama s Basuki classmates  Bandug Winadijanto  who claims that not a lot has changed at the school since the two men were pupils  Insight reported that Obama s political opponents believed the school promoted Wahhabism  a fundamentalist form of Islam   and are seeking to prove it    It s not  an  Islamic school  It s general   Winadijanto said   There is a lot of Christians  Buddhists  also Confucian      So that s a mixed school   The Obama aide described Fox News  broadcasting of the Insight story  appallingly irresponsible   Fox News executive Bill Shine told CNN  Reliable Sources  anchor Howard Kurtz that some of the network s hosts were simply expressing their opinions and repeatedly cited Insight as the source of the allegations  Obama has noted in his two books   Dreams From My Father  and  The Audacity of Hope   that he spent two years in a Muslim school and another two years in a Catholic school while living in Indonesia from age 6 to 10
