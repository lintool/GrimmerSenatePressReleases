    Obama Says Energy Bill Helps Illinois by Doubling Ethanol Use  Investing in Clean Coal   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                            Obama Says Energy Bill Helps Illinois by Doubling Ethanol Use  Investing in Clean Coal Friday  July 29  2005  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green     Date  June 29  2005  Obama Says Energy Bill Helps Illinois by Doubling Ethanol Use  Investing in Clean Coal   WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Barack Obama Friday voted in favor of the comprehensive energy bill  saying it will help Illinois and start America down the path to energy independence by doubling ethanol use  greatly increasing the availability of E85 ethanol pumps  and investing in combination plug in hybrid and flexible fuel vehicles  as well as clean coal technology  However  he warned that bolder action is required if lawmakers are really serious about dealing with the high energy costs that are plaguing American consumers     This bill  while far from a solution  is a first step toward decreasing America s dependence on foreign oil   said Obama   It requires that 7 5 billion gallons of ethanol be mixed with gasoline by 2012  That s 7 5 billion gallons of fuel that will be grown in the corn fields of Illinois  and not imported from the deserts of the Middle East  The bill will also help triple the number of E85 ethanol fueling stations in the next year by providing a tax credit for their construction  This will help the millions of people who already drive flexible fuel vehicles to fill their tanks with fuel made from 85 percent ethanol that is 50 cents cheaper than regular gasoline      I am also pleased that the bill includes funding I requested for research into combination plug in hybrid and flexible fuel vehicles that could travel up to 500 miles per gallon of gasoline  as well as more investment into clean coal technology     The Energy bill will do the following      Create a Renewable Fuels Standard that will nearly double the amount of ethanol used by 2012      Provide up to a  30 000 tax credit for the construction of E85 ethanol fueling stations      Provide a  1 8 billion tax credit for investments in clean coal facilities      Provide  85 million to Southern Illinois University  Purdue University  and the University of Kentucky for research and testing on developing Illinois basin coal into transportation fuels      Provide  40 million for research on combined plug in hybrid and E85 flexible fuel vehicles that have the potential to drive 500 miles per gallon of gasoline used      Provide incentives to promote biofuels from agricultural resources    While voting for the bill  the Illinois Senator also said he believes that the legislation still falls short of what could and should be done to put America on the path to energy independence     Although this a step forward  it s not a very big step   said Obama   The Department of Energy predicts that American demand will jump by 50 percent over the next 15 years  Meanwhile  the conservative Heritage Foundation says this bill will do virtually nothing to reduce our dependence on foreign oil  And it won t reduce the price of gasoline paid by hardworking Americans  Even President Bush and supporters of the bill in Congress concede as much       We could have done more today  and we should do more in the future   We must accept and embrace the challenge of finding a solution to our dependence on foreign oil as one of the most pressing problems of our time  It won t be easy and it won t be without sacrifice  but we owe it to ourselves and to our children so that we can bring down gas prices  protect our environment  and strengthen our national security  This should be one of our top priorities in America         So  I vote for this bill reluctantly today  disappointed that we have missed our opportunity to do something bolder that would have put us on the path to energy independence  This bill should be the first step  not the last  in our journey towards energy independence
