   Obama to Propose Aid for Katrina Children   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                           Obama to Propose Aid for Katrina Children Thursday  February  2  2006  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Washington Contact  Robert Gibbs or Tommy Vietor   202  228 5511  Illinois Contact  Julian Green    Date  February 2  2006  Obama to Propose Aid for Katrina Children   WASHINGTON   U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  Thursday introduced legislation to help low income children from Hurricane Katrina affected areas by temporarily extending the Child Tax Credit to low income parents in counties affected by the storm    The legislation was introduced as an amendment to a  70 billion tax cut bill    This achieves two goals  First  it helps keep a promise the President made to rebuild the Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane Katrina   Obama said   Second  in a  70 billion bill laden with tax cuts for the wealthy and well connected  it sets aside less than 1 percent for our neediest children     On September 15  2005  President Bush stood in the ruins of New Orleans and vowed to  do what it takes  to help the region recover  He also acknowledged the terrifying images of abject poverty that struck Americans on their TV screens and said   We have a duty to confront this poverty with bold action    Five months later  the President has not followed through with bold actions  while the neediest families struggled to put their lives back together    This uses a cost effective and proven tool in our tax code  the Child Tax Credit  to extend aid to low income working families affected by Hurricane Katrina   Obama said     Since it was established in 1997  the Child Tax Credit has helped millions of parents with tax credits of up to  1 000 a year per child  However  the benefit is currently skewed so that many families who need it the most cannot get it  Because the credit does not begin to go into effect until a parent makes at least  11 000 a year  someone who works full time at minimum wage is ineligible to receive any of the credit  Millions more low income families can only receive a partial credit   Across the country  17 million chilX Eon Dm  dm31 Return Path  in Louisiana  Mississippi and Alabama did not receive the full credit    Senator Obama s amendment would temporarily extend the Child Tax Credit for parents in counties declared disaster areas in the storm   It would allow these parents to begin receiving the credit with the first dollar of earned income  instead of the current  11 000 floor   A parent who earns  10 000 a year  the equivalent of full time employment at minimum wage  would receive the entire  1 000 credit    We should send a simple message  if you work  your kids get a benefit   Obama said   That s a common sense way to support families with children  especially families that have experienced the devastation of a natural disaster      The amendment is narrowly tailored and fiscally responsible   It is aimed at families affected by the Hurricanes  and it provides short term support  expiring in 2008   Costs are offset by not extending the tax breaks on the investment income of people who earn more than  100 million a year    Floor Statement of Senator Barack Obama  Hurricane Katrina Child Assistance Amendment  Senate Floor  February 1  2006   Mr  President  I rise to speak about an amendment to the Tax Reconciliation bill that I intend to offer at the appropriate time     The Amendment achieves two goals   First  it helps keep a promise the President made to rebuild the Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane Katrina   Second  in a  70 billion bill laden with tax cuts for the wealthy and well connected  it sets aside less than 1 percent for the neediest in our society    Two weeks after Katrina made landfall  President Bush stood in the ruins of New Orleans and vowed to  do what it takes  to help the region recover  He also acknowledged the terrifying images of abject poverty that struck Americans on their TV screens and said   We have a duty to confront this poverty with bold action    Five months later  the President s timid actions have not matched his bold rhetoric   He has not lived up to his promises    My amendment uses a cost effective and proven tool in our tax code  the Child Tax Credit  to extend aid to low income working families affected by Hurricane Katrina     Enacted in 1997  the Child Credit allows families with qualifying children to receive a credit of  1 000 per child against their federal income tax   Unfortunately  the credit is skewed so that many families who need it the most can t get it     Under current law  families that earn less than  11 000 get no benefit from the refundable child credit   That means that a child is left out of the credit even if her parent works full time at minimum wage  which has not increased since 1997   And the child doesn t get the full benefit of the  1000 credit until her parent earns close to  18 000  or even more if the child has siblings       What s worse  if her parents  incomes stagnate  are disrupted for any reason  or the economy stalls and work hours or wages are reduced  the value of the credit drops or even disappears   Under current law  almost 17 million children get less than the full credit     We all know what happened to the families on the Gulf Coast due to Hurricane Katrina  and it will be a long time before these families can rebuild their lives    Many of the families in the affected states were evacuated to other areas  and many of them cannot even afford to go back   And the federal response so far has been inadequate to get these families effectively back on their feet     We need to do better  At a time when we are debating  70 billion of tax breaks  many of which will benefit those who need the least help  it is critical that we remember the worst off and the most vulnerable members of our society    When I went to Houston after the Hurricane  I met an evacuee from New Orleans who said to me   we had nothing before the hurricane  and now we ve got less than nothing    Life was hard for many families even before Katrina hit   In Louisiana  Mississippi  and Alabama  for example  more than 900 000 children under 17 years old were so poor that they got no child tax credit or only a partial credit   These states had among the highest rates of children too poor to get the full credit   In fact  more than 1 3 of the children in Mississippi and Louisiana didn t get the full benefit of the child tax credit     This amendment  at a cost of less than 1 percent of the overall Tax Reconciliation bill  will provide necessary assistance to many of these families   The amendment eliminates the income threshold that excluded all children in families with less than  11 000 of income     My amendment sends a simple message  if you work  your kids get a benefit   It provides a partial credit starting with the first dollar of a parent s income for families who lived in the areas affected by Hurricane Katrina       The amendment is simple   it says that the children of low income working parents affected by Hurricane Katrina will no longer be denied the child credit   You work  your kids get a benefit   If you don t work  no benefit   And if you want the full benefit  you have to earn at least  10 000  which is just about the income of a full time job at minimum wage     That s a common sense way to support families with children  especially families that have experienced the huge cost   psychological and financial   of a natural disaster     My amendment is also narrowly tailored and fiscally responsible   It is aimed at families affected by the Hurricanes  and it provides short term support  expiring in 2008    With this amendment  hundreds of thousands of this country s most disadvantaged children will see an increase in their credit   Katrina offered us a window into America s poverty   Let s not let that window close without doing something to provide a chance for America s children to rebuild their lives with dignity  hope  and opportunity    I yield the floor
