 or Derrick Crowe  Rep  SMITH  Legislation would aim to cut extreme global poverty in half by 2015 WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Chuck Hagel  R NE  and Maria Cantwell  D WA  have introduced the Global Poverty Act  S 2433   which requires the President to develop and implement a comprehensive policy to cut extreme global poverty in half by 2015 through aid  trade  debt relief  and coordination with the international community  businesses and NGOs   Representatives Adam Smith  D WA  and Spencer Bachus  R AL  sponsored the House version of the bill  H R  1302   which passed the House in September       Eliminating global poverty remains one of the greatest challenges we face  with billions of people around the world forced to live on just dollars a day     said Senator Obama      We can     and must     make it a priority of our foreign policy to commit to eliminating extreme poverty and ensuring every child has food  shelter  and clean drinking water   As we strive to rebuild America   s standing in the world  this legislation will not only commit to reducing global poverty  but will also demonstrate our promise and support to those in the developing world   Our commitment to the global economy has to extend beyond trade agreements that are more about increasing corporate profits than about helping workers and small farmers everywhere        Poverty  hunger  and disease will be among the most serious challenges confronting the world in the 21st century     Senator Hagel said      This legislation provides the President of the United States the framework and resources to help implement a comprehensive policy to reduce global poverty   It is the human condition that has always driven the great events of history   This is a responsibility of all citizens of the world      America needs to do more to help the 1 1 billion men  women and children throughout the world living on less than  1 a day by helping promote sustainable economic growth and development   said Senator Cantwell   We need to do more to save lives in the poorest countries  The U S  needs to implement a real plan to combat poverty on a global scale while also addressing the national security risks extreme poverty creates      Arguably no greater problem faces the world than global poverty  Nearly 2 7 billion people live on less than  2 a day and close to a billion people live on less than  1 a day   We have a moral obligation to craft an overall U S  strategy to decrease global poverty and eliminate extreme global poverty   After introducing this measure in the House for the past several years  I was pleased to see it pass this year with overwhelming bipartisan support   This bill   s Senate introduction is a significant step toward it becoming law     Representative Adam Smith said  For years  America has committed to improving the lives of the world   s poorest people   In 2000  the U S  joined more than 180 countries at the United Nations Millennium Summit and vowed to reduce global poverty by 2015   We are halfway towards this deadline  and it is time the United States makes it a priority of our foreign policy to meet this goal and help those who are struggling day to day   The Global Poverty Act  Declares it official U S  policy to promote the reduction of global poverty  the elimination of extreme global poverty  and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goal of cutting extreme global poverty in half by 2015  Requires the President to develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to carry out that policy   Includes guidelines for what the strategy should include   from aid  trade  and debt relief  to working with the international community  businesses and NGOs  to ensuring environmental sustainability   Requires that the President   s strategy include specific and measurable goals  efforts to be undertaken  benchmarks  and timetables   Requires the President to report back to Congress on progress made in the implementation of the global poverty strategy  This legislation is supported by a broad range of groups  including Bread for the World  CARE  Oxfam America  Habitat
