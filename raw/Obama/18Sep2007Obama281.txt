   Senate Passes Obama Hagel Provision Aimed at Preventing Nuclear Terrorism   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                            Senate Passes Obama Hagel Provision Aimed at Preventing Nuclear Terrorism Tuesday  September 18  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE    Contact  Amy Brundage  Obama  or Jordan Stark  Hagel  Legislation requires plan to secure global stockpiles of nuclear weapons and material by 2012 WASHINGTON  DC    The Senate recently passed a provision authored by Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Chuck Hagel  R NE  to help keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists  The legislation was included as an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2008 State Foreign Operations appropriations bill   The Obama Hagel amendment requires the President to submit to Congress a comprehensive plan for ensuring that all nuclear weapons and weapons usable material at vulnerable sites around the world are secure by 2012 from the threats that terrorists have shown they can pose        Securing nuclear weapons and weapons usable material at their source is the most direct and reliable way to prevent nuclear terrorism     said Senator Obama      It is imperative that we build and sustain a truly global effort under an aggressive timeline to secure  consolidate  and reduce stockpiles of nuclear weapons and weapons usable material to keep them out of the wrong hands        Nuclear proliferation will be one of the defining challenges for the United States and the world in the 21st century   The U S  must actively engage the international community in a constructive dialogue that will focus on strengthening the current international nuclear nonproliferation framework   This amendment provides the directive for development of a comprehensive strategy to adequately secure and account for nuclear stockpiles throughout the world   There is no higher priority for America and the world than to address this great threat to mankind     Senator Hagel said  Despite significant progress by the U S  to improve the security of nuclear stockpiles in some parts of the world  there are still significant quantities of weapons usable nuclear material that remain vulnerable to theft or diversion  For example  there are an estimated 60 tons of highly enriched uranium     enough to make over 1 000 nuclear bombs     that  are spread out at non military facilities in over 40 countries around the world   Physical security at these facilities varies significantly  creating dangerous vulnerabilities to theft or diversion   In addition to requiring a plan to secure nuclear weapons and weapons usable material by 2012  the Obama Hagel amendment would require the U S   to work with other countries to ensure adequate accounting and security of nuclear stockpiles on an ongoing basis thereafter   The amendment would further require the U S  to ensure that its own nuclear weapons stockpile and weapons usable material are adequately protected  This provision was one component of the Obama Hagel Nuclear Weapons Threat Reduction Act  S  1977   which was introduced in August   That bill would promote U S  leadership in a global effort to prevent nuclear terrorism  reduce global nuclear arsenals  and stop the spread of nuclear weapons and related technology   The provisions of S  1977 include the following   support for an international nuclear fuel reserve to discourage countries from building their own uranium enrichment capability  additional funding to strengthen the inspection capabilities of the International Atomic Energy Agency  IAEA   talks with Russia to further reduce global nuclear arsenals  progress on a verifiable global ban on the production of fissile material for weapons  reconsideration of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty  expansion of export controls and interdiction capabilities  and the establishment of a commission to develop recommendations about U S  nonproliferation policy
