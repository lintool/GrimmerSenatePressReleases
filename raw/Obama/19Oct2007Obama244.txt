   Obama Demands Investigation into Subprime Loan Discrimination   U S  Senator Barack Obama                       Barack Obama                                                                             Obama Demands Investigation into Subprime Loan Discrimination Thursday  October 18  2007  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                  CONTACT  Amy Brundage  202 228 5511 Asks FTC to examine whether minority homeowners are being targeted with high priced loans WASHINGTON  D C      U S  Senator Barack Obama  D IL  today sent the following letter to FTC Commissioner Deborah Platt Majoras  calling on her to investigate the marketing practices of subprime lenders and the brokers of subprime loans to determine whether minority borrowers have been victims of discrimination   According to recent studies  and an editorial in the New York Times  there is increasing evidence that black and Hispanic borrowers were more likely to be steered to high cost subprime loans than other borrowers   Hundreds of thousands of African American families     many of whom probably should have been eligible for lower cost prime loans instead of riskier subprime loans     could potentially lose their homes in the coming years   In the letter  Obama requests that the FTC investigate whether there is evidence that lenders or brokers target poor or minority borrowers with higher cost products  whether lenders are engaging in deceptive marketing practices  and whether the lack of lower cost borrowing options has disproportionately disadvantaged minority borrowers  The text of the letter is below  October 18  2007    The Honorable Deborah Platt Majoras  Federal Trade Commission  600 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W     Washington  D C  20580   Dear Commissioner Majoras  I am writing to bring to your attention the attached editorial from yesterday s New York Times which begins   Evidence is mounting that during the housing boom  black and Hispanic borrowers were far more likely to be steered into high cost subprime loans than other borrowers  even after controlling for factors such as income  loan size and property location     Subprime in Black and White   The New York Times  October 17  2007   In reality  such evidence has been mounting since the 1990s when the Clinton Administration found that subprime loans in 1998 were over four times more prevalent in predominantly black neighborhoods in New York than in predominantly white neighborhoods   More recent studies have found similar examples of potentially discriminatory lending patterns     Last year  for example  the Center for Responsible Lending found that for most types of subprime home loans  minority borrowers are more likely to pay higher rates than white borrowers even after accounting for differences in credit scores  loan to value ratios  and other underwriting criteria   And just this week another analysis confirmed that even high income black borrowers are more likely than comparable white borrowers to have risky and costly subprime loans   Black families are paying more for home loans than similarly situated white families  Effective action to address this disparity is long overdue   I call upon the FTC to investigate the marketing practices of subprime lenders and the brokers of subprime loans to determine if minority borrowers have been the victims of discrimination   Among other things  the Federal Trade Commission is charged with protecting consumers from unfair or deceptive marketing acts or practices   Many subprime loans include sales practices or loan features that are potentially unfair and deceptive for borrowers   Some practices  such as yield spread premiums  which encourage mortgage brokers to steer borrowers into the most costly products  or prepayment penalties  which enable lenders to offer mortgages that are unsupported by sound underwriting principles  appear to be the source of significant problems faced by many subprime borrowers   With an estimated 53  of African American borrowers in 2005 receiving subprime loans  and more than 60  of subprime loans containing prepayment penalties  the risks particularly for African American homeowners are substantial   Indeed  hundreds of thousands of African American families     many of whom probably should have been eligible for lower cost prime loans instead of riskier subprime loans     are expected to face loss of their homes in the coming years   I request that you begin a thorough investigation within five days and provide a status report to my office within 15 days on the following questions  1   Whether there is evidence of lenders or brokers specifically targeting poor or minority borrowers with higher cost products than would otherwise be justified based on legitimate underwriting criteria   2   Whether the marketing of lending products to poor or minority borrowers has been deceptive or unfair   Specifically  whether the disclosure of yield spread premiums and prepayment penalties has been sufficiently transparent to borrowers and whether such or similar sales and pricing practices have been disproportionately detrimental to minority borrowers     3   Whether the lack of lower cost borrowing options  including those regulated by the Federal government  in predominantly minority communities even for higher income borrowers  has disproportionately disadvantaged minority borrowers in their efforts to realize the dream of affordable home ownership and wealth building     Thank you for your assistance protecting all consumers from the pernicious affects of predatory and discriminatory lending practices which undermine the American dream    Sincerely    Barack Obama  United States Senator
