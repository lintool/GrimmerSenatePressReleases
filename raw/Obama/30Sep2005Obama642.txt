Illinois Contact  Julian Green     Date  September 22  2005 Remarks of Senator Barack Obama on the Confirmation of Judge John Roberts   First of all  let me congratulate Senator Specter and Senator Leahy for moving the process of confirming the nomination of Judge Roberts along with such civility  a civility that I believe speaks well of the Senate   Let me also say that I remain distressed that the White House during this confirmation process  which overall went smoothly  failed to provide critical documents as part of the record that could have provided us with a better basis to make our judgment with respect to the nomination   This White House continues to stymie efforts on the part of the Senate to do its job   I hope with the next nominee who comes up for the Supreme Court that the White House recognizes that in fact it is its duty not just to the Senate but to the American people to make sure we can thoroughly and adequately evaluate the record of every single nominee who comes before us   Having said that  the decision with respect to Judge Roberts  nomination has not been an easy one for me to make   As some of you know  I have not only argued cases before appellate courts but for 10 years was a member of the University of Chicago Law School faculty and taught courses in constitutional law   Part of the culture of the University of Chicago Law School faculty is to maintain a sense of collegiality between those people who hold different views   What engenders respect is not the particular outcome that a legal scholar arrives at but  rather  the intellectual rigor and honesty with which he or she arrives at a decision    Given that background  I am sorely tempted to vote for Judge Roberts based on my study of his resume  his conduct during the hearings  and a conversation I had with him yesterday afternoon  There is absolutely no doubt in my mind Judge Roberts is qualified to sit on the highest court in the land   Moreover  he seems to have the comportment and the temperament that makes for a good judge   He is humble  he is personally decent  and he appears to be respectful of different points of view   It is absolutely clear to me that Judge Roberts truly loves the law   He couldn t have achieved his excellent record as an advocate before the Supreme Court without that passion for the law  and it became apparent to me in our conversation that he does  in fact  deeply respect the basic precepts that go into deciding 95 percent of the cases that come before the Federal court    adherence to precedence  a certain modesty in reading statutes and constitutional text  a respect for procedural regularity  and an impartiality in presiding over the adversarial system   All of these characteristics make me want to vote for Judge Roberts    The problem I face    a problem that has been voiced by some of my other colleagues  both those who are voting for Mr  Roberts and those who are voting against Mr  Roberts    is that while adherence to legal precedent and rules of statutory or constitutional construction will dispose of 95 percent of the cases that come before a court  so that both a Scalia and a Ginsburg will arrive at the same place most of the time on those 95 percent of the cases    what matters on the Supreme Court is those 5 percent of cases that are truly difficult   In those cases  adherence to precedent and rules of construction and interpretation will only get you through the 25th mile of the marathon   That last mile can only be determined on the basis of one s deepest values  one s core concerns  one s broader perspectives on how the world works  and the depth and breadth of one s empathy   In those 5 percent of hard cases  the constitutional text will not be directly on point   The language of the statute will not be perfectly clear   Legal process alone will not lead you to a rule of decision   In those circumstances  your decisions about whether affirmative action is an appropriate response to the history of discrimination in this country or whether a general right of privacy encompasses a more specific right of women to control their reproductive decisions or whether the commerce clause empowers Congress to speak on those issues of broad national concern that may be only tangentially related to what is easily defined as interstate commerce  whether a person who is disabled has the right to be accommodated so they can work alongside those who are nondisabled    in those difficult cases  the critical ingredient is supplied by what is in the judge s heart   I talked to Judge Roberts about this   Judge Roberts confessed that  unlike maybe professional politicians  it is not easy for him to talk about his values and his deeper feelings   That is not how he is trained   He did say he doesn t like bullies and has always viewed the law as a way of evening out the playing field between the strong and the weak    I was impressed with that statement because I view the law in much the same way   The problem I had is that when I examined Judge Roberts  record and history of public service  it is my personal estimation that he has far more often used his formidable skills on behalf of the strong in opposition to the weak   In his work in the White House and the Solicitor General s Office  he seemed to have consistently sided with those who were dismissive of efforts to eradicate the remnants of racial discrimination in our political process  In these same positions  he seemed dismissive of the concerns that it is harder to make it in this world and in this economy when you are a woman rather than a man    I want to take Judge Roberts at his word that he doesn t like bullies and he sees the law and the Court as a means of evening the playing field between the strong and the weak   But given the gravity of the position to which he will undoubtedly ascend and the gravity of the decisions in which he will undoubtedly participate during his tenure on the Court  I ultimately have to give more weight to his deeds and the overarching political philosophy that he appears to have shared with those in power than to the assuring words that he provided me in our meeting    The bottom line is this   I will be voting against John Roberts  nomination   I do so with considerable reticence   I hope that I am wrong   I hope that this reticence on my part proves unjustified and that Judge Roberts will show himself to not only be an outstanding legal thinker but also someone who upholds the Court s historic role as a check on the majoritarian impulses of the executive branch and the legislative branch   I hope that he will recognize who the weak are and who the strong are in our society   I hope that his jurisprudence is one that stands up to the bullies of all ideological stripes  Let me conclude with just one more comment about this confirmation process     I was deeply disturbed by some statements that were made by largely Democratic advocacy groups when ranking member Senator Leahy announced that he would support Judge Roberts   Although the scales have tipped in a different direction for me  I am deeply admiring of the work and the thought that Senator Leahy has put into making his decision   The knee jerk unbending and what I consider to be unfair attacks on Senator Leahy s motives were unjustified   Unfortunately  both parties have fallen victim to this kind of pressure   I believe every Senator on the other side of the aisle  if they were honest  would acknowledge that the same unyielding  unbending  dogmatic approach to judicial confirmation has in large part been responsible for the kind of poisonous atmosphere that exists in this Chamber regarding judicial nominations   It is tempting  then  for us on this side of the aisle to go tit for tat    But what I would like to see is for all of us to recognize as we move forward to the next nominee that in fact the issues that are confronted by the Supreme Court are difficult issues   That is why they get up to the Supreme Court   The issues facing the Court are rarely black and white  and all advocacy groups who have a legitimate and profound interest in the decisions that are made by the Court should try to make certain that their advocacy reflects that complexity   These groups on the right and left should not resort to the sort of broad brush dogmatic attacks that have hampered the process in the past and constrained each and every Senator in this Chamber from making sure that they are voting on the basis of their conscience    Thank you very much
